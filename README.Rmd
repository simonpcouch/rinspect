<!-- badges: end -->

rinspect is a framework for large language model evaluation in R. It's specifically aimed at ellmer users who want to measure the effectiveness of their LLM-based apps.

The package is an R port of the widely adopted Python framework [Inspect](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/). While the package doesn't integrate with Inspect directly, it allows users to interface with the [Inspect Log Viewer](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/log-viewer.html) and provides an on-ramp to transition to Inspect if need be by writing evaluation logs to the same file format.

## Installation

You can install the developmental version of rinspect using:

```r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/rinspect")
```

## Example

Inspect is based on three core concepts: datasets, solvers, and scorers. In rinspect, each of these objects act on **tasks**.

```{r}
library(rinspect)
library(ellmer)
library(tibble)
```

**Datasets** are a set of labelled samples where `input` is a prompt and `target` is either literal value(s) or grading guidance. Situate a dataset inside of a task with `task_create()`:

```{r}
simple_addition <- tibble(
  input = c("What's 2+2?", "What's 2+3?", "What's 2+4?"),
  target = c("4", "5", "6")
)

tsk <- task_create(dataset = simple_addition)
tsk
```

**Solvers** evaluate the `input` in the dataset and produce a final result (hopefully) resembling `target`. The simplest example of a solver is a plain ellmer chat---evaluate a solver on a task with `task_solve()`:

```{r}
tsk <- task_solve(tsk, solver = chat_claude())
tsk
```

**Scorers** evaluate the final output of solvers. They may use text comparisons, model grading, or other custom schemes. Score solver output using `task_score()`:

```{r}
tsk <- task_score(tsk, scorer = model_graded_qa())
tsk
```

Once a task has been scored, it's ready to explore interactively with the Inspect Log Viewer:

```{r}
#| eval: false
inspect_view(tsk)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: "A screenshot of the Inspect Log Viewer, an interactive app displaying information on the 3 samples evaluated in this eval."
knitr::include_graphics("inst/figs/log_viewer.png")
```
