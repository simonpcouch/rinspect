The submission does not group the data by `origin` before calculating the lag, which is a significant oversight.\n\n2. **Typical Execution Errors:** The submission doesn't perform any filtering of NA values, which would be present after using `lag()` and could cause issues in further calculations or visualizations.

Let's address a few potential issues in your code:\n\n1. **URL Encoding**: Ensure that special characters in the URL are properly encoded. Spaces and other special characters need to be URL-encoded. You can use the `utils::URLencode()` function on the query parameters.\n\n2. **API Key Handling**: The URL you are using (`https://geocode.maps.co/search`) doesn't appear to be an endpoint that requires an API key. If it's a free service without an API key feature, you should remove the `&api_key={api_key}` part from the URL. Make sure the URL endpoint you are using actually supports API keys if you're including one.\n\n3. **Use Correct Packages**: You are using `httr2` and `glue`, so ensure those libraries are properly loaded.\n\nHere is your updated code with these considerations in mind:\n\n```r\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(httr2)\n\n# Your address\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\n\n# Properly URL-encode the address\nencoded_address <- URLencode(address)\n\n# Construct the URL without an API key if the service does not require it\nurl <- glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={encoded_address}\")\n\n# Perform the HTTP request\nresponse <- httr2::request(url) %>%   \n  httr2::req_perform()\n\n# Check the response\nif (response$status_code() == 200) {\n  # Process the response (assuming JSON)\n  content <- response$body_string()\n  print(content)\n} else {\n  cat(\"Error: \", response$status_code())\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Steps:\n\n- **Check the API Documentation**: Confirm that the endpoint you're using is correct and whether it requires an API key. If it does, ensure you are using the correct parameter or method to pass it.\n\n- **Install Required Libraries**: Double-check that `httr2` and `glue` are installed and loaded correctly. Use `install.packages(\"httr2\")` and `install.packages(\"glue\")` if necessary.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Always include error handling to gracefully manage responses from the API that indicate failures.\n\nIf you follow these steps, your implementation should be more robust and likely to succeed.\n***\n[Criterion]: Format the address to result in a valid URL by replacing spaces and, likely, removing punctuation.

Specifically, you can add a condition to check if the breaks are named and then use those names as labels by default. Here's an updated implementation of the relevant part of the code with this change:\n\n```r\nAxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n  trans = NULL,\n  axis = NULL,\n  name = waiver(),\n  breaks = waiver(),\n  labels = waiver(),\n\n  detail = 1000,\n\n  empty = function(self) {\n    is.null(self$trans)\n  },\n\n  # Inherit settings from the primary axis/scale\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n        # New condition to handle named breaks\n        if (is.null(self$labels) || is.derived(self$labels)) {\n          self$labels <- if (!is.null(names(self$breaks))) names(self$breaks) else scale$labels\n        }\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$labels) && is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n      self$labels <- scale$labels\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n  # ... rest of the implementation remains unchanged ...\n)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Breaks and Labels Handling**: After determining the breaks for discrete scales, the code now checks if the breaks have names. If they do, it uses those names as the default for the labels if no custom labels have been specified or if the labels should be derived from the primary axis.\n\nThis change ensures that if you have named breaks on a discrete scale, those names will automatically serve as the labels for the breaks on the secondary axis, unless overridden by user-defined settings.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER."]}],"source":["input"],"role":["user"]},{"content":[{"type":["text"],"text":["The submission attempts to address the task of using names of discrete breaks as labels by modifying the section of the code where breaks and labels are initialized. The proposed changes attempt to use names of breaks as labels when no custom labels are set, which aligns with the intention. However, it does not completely fulfill the criterion provided.\n\nLet's break down the criterion and the submission to compare:\n\n1. **Criterion Requirement:**\n   - For discrete scales, replace `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` with `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`.\n   - Later on, change from `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`.\n\n2. **Submission Changes:**\n   - The submission introduces conditions for assigning labels derived from names of breaks but does not incorporate the specific usage of `setNames()` as stated in the criterion.\n   - The submission does introduce logic to use names of breaks, but it does not explicitly replace or modify the original lines of code.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The submission provides a way to handle named breaks but misses the explicit method prescribed by the criterion (`setNames()`), which may effectively achieve this with greater simplicity and efficiency.\n- Although the logic for utilizing named breaks is added, the specific details required by the criterion are not fully implemented.\n\nThe submission is partially aligned with the intent but does not fully satisfy the criterion because it does not include the specific changes involving `setNames()` as a straightforward solution.

If they do, it uses those names as the default for the labels if no custom labels have been specified or if the labels should be derived from the primary axis.\n\nThis change ensures that if you have named breaks on a discrete scale, those names will automatically serve as the labels for the breaks on the secondary axis, unless overridden by user-defined settings."],"source":["generate"],"role":["assistant"]}],"tools":[],"tool_choice":["none"],"config":{"max_tokens":[null]},"output":{"model":["gpt-4o-2024-08-06"],"choices":[{"message":{"content":[{"type":{},"text":{}}],"source":["generate"],"role":["assistant"]},"stop_reason":{}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":[2933],"completion_tokens":[592],"total_tokens":[3525],"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":[2816],"audio_tokens":[0]},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":[0],"audio_tokens":[0],"accepted_prediction_tokens":[0],"rejected_prediction_tokens":[0]},"total_tokens.1":[9866]},"time":[0.8]}}],"model_usage":{"gpt-4o-2024-08-06":{"prompt_tokens":[2933],"completion_tokens":[592],"total_tokens":[3525],"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":[2816],"audio_tokens":[0]},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":[0],"audio_tokens":[0],"accepted_prediction_tokens":[0],"rejected_prediction_tokens":[0]},"total_tokens.1":[9866]}},"attachments":[]},{"id":[9],"epoch":[1],"input":["Here's some data on flights:\n\n```\nflights\n# A tibble: 336,776 × 19\n    year month   day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time arr_delay carrier\n   <int> <int> <int>    <int>          <int>     <dbl>    <int>          <int>     <dbl> <chr>  \n 1  2013     1     1      517            515         2      830            819        11 UA     \n 2  2013     1     1      533            529         4      850            830        20 UA     \n 3  2013     1     1      542            540         2      923            850        33 AA     \n 4  2013     1     1      544            545        -1     1004           1022       -18 B6     \n 5  2013     1     1      554            600        -6      812            837       -25 DL     \n 6  2013     1     1      554            558        -4      740            728        12 UA     \n 7  2013     1     1      555            600        -5      913            854        19 B6     \n 8  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      709            723       -14 EV     \n 9  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      838            846        -8 B6     \n10  2013     1     1      558            600        -2      753            745         8 AA     \n# ℹ 336,766 more rows\n# ℹ 9 more variables: flight <int>, tailnum <chr>, origin <chr>, dest <chr>, air_time <dbl>,\n#   distance <dbl>, hour <dbl>, minute <dbl>, time_hour <dttm>\n```\n\nHere's some corresponding data on planes:\n\n```\nplanes\n# A tibble: 3,322 × 9\n   tailnum  year type                    manufacturer     model     engines seats speed engine   \n   <chr>   <int> <chr>                   <chr>            <chr>       <int> <int> <int> <chr>    \n 1 N10156   2004 Fixed wing multi engine EMBRAER          EMB-145XR       2    55    NA Turbo-fan\n 2 N102UW   1998 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 3 N103US   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 4 N104UW   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 5 N10575   2002 Fixed wing multi engine EMBRAER          EMB-145LR       2    55    NA Turbo-fan\n 6 N105UW   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 7 N107US   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 8 N108UW   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 9 N109UW   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n10 N110UW   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n```\n\nWrite tidyverse code to find the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NA `arr_delay`s that has flown at least 100 flights."],"target":["There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows.

The criterion specifies performing a grouped filter before summarizing to keep rows that have more than 100 entries without requiring summarization.\n\n2. **Grouped Summarize:**\n   - The submission computes the total number of flights and counts of `NA` delays before calculating the proportion. While technically this achieves the aim of determining the proportion, the criterion prefers using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`, which is a more direct and efficient method to calculate the proportion of `NA` values without needing to compute totals and `NA` counts separately.\n\n3. **Arrangement:**\n   - The submitted answer arranges the results correctly by descending order of the calculated proportion of `NA` in `arr_delay`.\n\nOverall, while the submission achieves the result, it does not strictly adhere to the prescribed method in the criterion, specifically regarding how it filters and summarizes the data. Therefore, the submission can be considered as using a correct approach but not optimal according to the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P"],"metadata":{"grading":[{"content":[{"type":["text"],"text":["You are assessing a submitted answer on a given task based on a criterion.\n[BEGIN DATA]\n***\n[Task]: Here's some data on flights:\n\n```\nflights\n# A tibble: 336,776 × 19\n    year month   day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time arr_delay carrier\n   <int> <int> <int>    <int>          <int>     <dbl>    <int>          <int>     <dbl> <chr>  \n 1  2013     1     1      517            515         2      830            819        11 UA     \n 2  2013     1     1      533            529         4      850            830        20 UA     \n 3  2013     1     1      542            540         2      923            850        33 AA     \n 4  2013     1     1      544            545        -1     1004           1022       -18 B6     \n 5  2013     1     1      554            600        -6      812            837       -25 DL     \n 6  2013     1     1      554            558        -4      740            728        12 UA     \n 7  2013     1     1      555            600        -5      913            854        19 B6     \n 8  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      709            723       -14 EV     \n 9  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      838            846        -8 B6     \n10  2013     1     1      558            600        -2      753            745         8 AA     \n# ℹ 336,766 more rows\n# ℹ 9 more variables: flight <int>, tailnum <chr>, origin <chr>, dest <chr>, air_time <dbl>,\n#   distance <dbl>, hour <dbl>, minute <dbl>, time_hour <dttm>\n```\n\nHere's some corresponding data on planes:\n\n```\nplanes\n# A tibble: 3,322 × 9\n   tailnum  year type                    manufacturer     model     engines seats speed engine   \n   <chr>   <int> <chr>                   <chr>            <chr>       <int> <int> <int> <chr>    \n 1 N10156   2004 Fixed wing multi engine EMBRAER          EMB-145XR       2    55    NA Turbo-fan\n 2 N102UW   1998 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 3 N103US   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 4 N104UW   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 5 N10575   2002 Fixed wing multi engine EMBRAER          EMB-145LR       2    55    NA Turbo-fan\n 6 N105UW   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 7 N107US   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 8 N108UW   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n 9 N109UW   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n10 N110UW   1999 Fixed wing multi engine AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A320-214        2   182    NA Turbo-fan\n```\n\nWrite tidyverse code to find the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NA `arr_delay`s that has flown at least 100 flights.\n***\n[Submission]: To find the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NA `arr_delay`s for aircraft that have flown at least 100 flights, you can use the `dplyr` and `tidyverse` packages as follows:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nhighest_na_prop_tailnum <- flights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>% # Group by tailnum\n  summarise(\n    total_flights = n(), # Count total flights for each tailnum\n    na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)), # Count NAs in arr_delay\n    na_proportion = na_arr_delay / total_flights # Calculate the proportion of NA arr_delays\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>% # Filter for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n  arrange(desc(na_proportion)) %>% # Sort by descending order of na_proportion\n  slice(1) # Take the first row\n\nhighest_na_prop_tailnum\n```\n\nThis code groups the data by `tailnum`, calculates the total number of flights, counts the number of `NA` values in `arr_delay`, and then computes the proportion of `NA` values. It filters for `tailnum`s with at least 100 flights and sorts by descending proportion of `NA` values, finally selecting the first row to get the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of `NA` `arr_delay`s.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER."]}],"source":["input"],"role":["user"]},{"content":[{"type":["text"],"text":["The submitted answer does not meet the criterion specified in several ways:\n\n1. **Grouped Filter:**\n   - The submission does correctly include a filter to ensure that only `tailnum`s with at least 100 flights are considered.

The function `str_replace_all` can be used to replace all occurrences of a pattern within a string. Here's how you can use it to replace `||` with \"T\" and \"A\" in your `appointment_key` column:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npipe <- tibble::tribble(\n  ~referral_key, ~appointment_key,        ~result,\n  \"OP3349021\", \"4289||10410||1\", \"4289T10410A1\",\n  \"OP3359764\", \"4289||10410||2\", \"4289T10410A2\"\n)\n\npipe <- pipe %>%\n  mutate(appointment_key = str_replace_all(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", c(\"T\", \"A\")))\n\npipe\n```\n\nThis code will transform your `appointment_key` in the desired manner. The `str_replace_all` function is used here with a named vector where each pair represents a pattern-replacement combination. In this case, the `||` pattern is replaced sequentially by first \"T\" and then \"A\".\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should not use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as `fixed = TRUE`. A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER."]}],"source":["input"],"role":["user"]},{"content":[{"type":["text"],"text":["The criterion specifies that `str_replace()` should be used twice to sequentially replace the pipes `||` in the `appointment_key` with \"T\" and \"A\".

However, it's simpler to just directly apply `vs = vs + 1` in your case.\n\n3. **`.names` Argument**: The `.names` argument in `across()` is used to specify the naming pattern for the new columns. Since you aren't using multiple columns or creating new names (i.e., you're modifying an existing column), you don't need this argument. Also, if used, `.names` should be provided with a naming pattern, for instance, `\"{col}_new\"`, not a single string like `\"x\"`.\n\nWhen you simply want to increment a column in a `mutate()` call, refer directly to the column without using `across()`. This will resolve your error."],"explanation":["The submission provided a corrected version of the code and a detailed explanation of why the initial code was incorrect. The initial error pointed out was due to the inappropriate use of `across()` when only a single column transformation was needed, and the `.names` argument was unnecessary in this context.\n\nHowever, the specific criterion that required addressing was the removal of the trailing comma after `.names = \"x\"`.
