                  "text": "Certainly! In **ggplot2**, to make the **bar heights represent proportions** (rather than raw counts) **within each `cut`**, you can use the `position = \"fill\"` argument in `geom_bar()`. This stacks the bars **so that each bar has the same height (1) and segments show the proportion for each `clarity`** within each `cut`.\n\nHere's how you would modify your code:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = \"fill\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `position = \"fill\"` makes the height of each bar 1, and the **segments correspond to the proportion of each `clarity` within each `cut`**.\n\n---\n\n**Additional tip:**  \nIf you want the y-axis to display proportions (0-1) as percentages, you can add:\n\n```r\nscale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n```\n\n**Full code with percentage y-axis:**\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)\n```\n\nThis way, you'll see **proportional bars stacked by clarity** for each cut.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted solution correctly implements the criteria for the flag:\n1. At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nThe submission uses `dplyr` and `tidyr` to group by ID and performs two checks:\n1. Correctly identifies if any \"Type_II\" exists for each ID using `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n2. However, there's a critical error in the logic for the Type_I check - the code checks if Type_I visits are at least 90 days apart, but the criterion requires them to be within 90 days of one another.\n\nThe criterion solutions correctly identify this with either:\n- `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` - checking if any sequential Type_I dates are 90 days or less apart\n- `flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90` - checking if records are within 90 days of the previous record\n\nAdditionally, the submission incorrectly combines the conditions with `&` (AND), meaning both conditions must be true. The task description suggests these should be separate criteria where either condition triggers the flag (OR logic).\n\nThe submitted code is therefore incorrect in two fundamental ways:\n1. It checks for Type_I dates that are at least 90 days apart instead of within 90 days\n2. It requires both conditions to be true instead of either one\n\nGRADE: I",

However, there's a critical error in the logic for the Type_I check - the code checks if Type_I visits are at least 90 days apart, but the criterion requires them to be within 90 days of one another.\n\nThe criterion solutions correctly identify this with either:\n- `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` - checking if any sequential Type_I dates are 90 days or less apart\n- `flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90` - checking if records are within 90 days of the previous record\n\nAdditionally, the submission incorrectly combines the conditions with `&` (AND), meaning both conditions must be true. The task description suggests these should be separate criteria where either condition triggers the flag (OR logic).\n\nThe submitted code is therefore incorrect in two fundamental ways:\n1. It checks for Type_I dates that are at least 90 days apart instead of within 90 days\n2. It requires both conditions to be true instead of either one\n\nGRADE: I",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion for setting a conditional boolean flag based on two specific criteria:\n1. At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLooking at the submitted answer, there appears to be a critical misunderstanding in the implementation of the second criterion. The submission checks for Type_I visits that are \"at least 90 days apart,\" whereas the task requires finding Type_I visits that are \"within at least 90 days of one another\" (meaning the difference should be ≤ 90 days, not ≥ 90 days).\n\nIn the code implementation:\n```r\nany(abs(outer(dates, dates, \"-\")) >= 90 & abs(outer(dates, dates, \"-\")) != 0)\n```\n\nThis is checking if any pair of dates has a difference of 90 or more days, which is the opposite of what's required. The criterion states we need to find dates that are within 90 days of each other (i.e., difference ≤ 90 days).\n\nAdditionally, the flag should be set if EITHER condition is met (at least one Type_II OR two Type_I within 90 days), but the code uses `type_ii & type_i_flag`, which means BOTH conditions must be true.\n\nThese are fundamental logical errors that would produce incorrect results. The criterion solution correctly uses:\n```r\nany(type == \"Type_II\") | any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n```\n\nThis properly implements the OR condition and correctly checks for dates within 90 days of each other.\n\nGRADE: I",

The criterion states we need to find dates that are within 90 days of each other (i.e., difference ≤ 90 days).\n\nAdditionally, the flag should be set if EITHER condition is met (at least one Type_II OR two Type_I within 90 days), but the code uses `type_ii & type_i_flag`, which means BOTH conditions must be true.\n\nThese are fundamental logical errors that would produce incorrect results. The criterion solution correctly uses:\n```r\nany(type == \"Type_II\") | any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n```\n\nThis properly implements the OR condition and correctly checks for dates within 90 days of each other.\n\nGRADE: I",

Here’s a tidyverse approach using `dplyr` and `tidyr`.\n\n## **Step-by-step Solution**\n\n### **1. For each ID:**\n- **Has at least one `\"Type_II\"`**: This is easy, just check if any row in the group is Type_II.\n- **Has at least two `\"Type_I\"` that are at least 90 days apart**: \n    - Filter to `\"Type_I\"` only.\n    - Sort by date.\n    - For each pair, check if any two Type_I dates are at least 90 days apart.\n\n### **2. Set Flag**\n- If both conditions are met, Flag = 1, else Flag = 0.\n\n---\n\n## **Code**\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    has_type_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    # Compute if two Type_I visits are at least 90 days apart\n    has_type1_90 =\n      {\n        type1_dates <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]\n        length(type1_dates) >= 2 &&\n          max(outer(type1_dates, type1_dates, FUN = function(a, b) abs(as.integer(a - b)))) >= 90\n      },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_ii & has_type1_90)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\n### **Output**\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Explanation**\n- `outer(type1_dates, type1_dates, ...)` computes all possible date differences (absolute values).\n- Check if the maximum such difference is at least 90 (i.e., there are at least two Type_I dates 90 days apart).\n- Both conditions must be true for Flag to be 1.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you need further explanation or tweaks!**"

Here’s a tidyverse approach using `dplyr` and `tidyr`.\n\n## **Step-by-step Solution**\n\n### **1. For each ID:**\n- **Has at least one `\"Type_II\"`**: This is easy, just check if any row in the group is Type_II.\n- **Has at least two `\"Type_I\"` that are at least 90 days apart**: \n    - Filter to `\"Type_I\"` only.\n    - Sort by date.\n    - For each pair, check if any two Type_I dates are at least 90 days apart.\n\n### **2. Set Flag**\n- If both conditions are met, Flag = 1, else Flag = 0.\n\n---\n\n## **Code**\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    has_type_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    # Compute if two Type_I visits are at least 90 days apart\n    has_type1_90 =\n      {\n        type1_dates <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]\n        length(type1_dates) >= 2 &&\n          max(outer(type1_dates, type1_dates, FUN = function(a, b) abs(as.integer(a - b)))) >= 90\n      },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_ii & has_type1_90)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\n### **Output**\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Explanation**\n- `outer(type1_dates, type1_dates, ...)` computes all possible date differences (absolute values).\n- Check if the maximum such difference is at least 90 (i.e., there are at least two Type_I dates 90 days apart).\n- Both conditions must be true for Flag to be 1.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you need further explanation or tweaks!**",

This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

Here, we'll use the **tidyverse** approach in **R** to visualize the relationship between the departure delay of a flight and the previous flight's departure delay.\n\n**Step-by-step R code:**\n\n1. **Arrange the data** in departure order.\n2. **Add a lagged column** for the previous flight's departure delay.\n3. **Plot** the mean dep_delay for each specific pairing.\n\n## Full Code Example\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))\n\n# We want to plot mean dep_delay vs prev_dep_delay, so we need to group by prev_dep_delay.\n# Because delays can be any value, typically we bin (bucket) them for a smoother plot.\n\nflights_binned <- flights_lagged %>%\n  mutate(prev_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks=seq(-50, 500, by=10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE),\n            prev_delay = mean(prev_dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE),\n            n = n()) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_delay_bin), n > 25) # Remove small groups\n\nggplot(flights_binned, aes(x = prev_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs Previous Flight's Departure Delay\"\n  )\n```\n\n### **Explanation**\n\n- `arrange(year, month, day, dep_time)` makes sure flights are in temporal order.\n- `prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)` creates a column with previous row's `dep_delay`.\n- `cut()` bins previous delays, as exact values are noisy; change bin width as needed.\n- `group_by()` and `summarise()` calculate mean departure delay for each bin.\n- `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()` visualize the trend.\n\n---\n\n**Visualization insight:**  \nIf there's a temporal correlation, you'll see a positive trend: higher departure delays in the previous flight are associated with higher delays in the next.\n\nLet me know if you want to see it with raw points (not binned) or for a specific subset (like per carrier or airport)!"

Here, we'll use the **tidyverse** approach in **R** to visualize the relationship between the departure delay of a flight and the previous flight's departure delay.\n\n**Step-by-step R code:**\n\n1. **Arrange the data** in departure order.\n2. **Add a lagged column** for the previous flight's departure delay.\n3. **Plot** the mean dep_delay for each specific pairing.\n\n## Full Code Example\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))\n\n# We want to plot mean dep_delay vs prev_dep_delay, so we need to group by prev_dep_delay.\n# Because delays can be any value, typically we bin (bucket) them for a smoother plot.\n\nflights_binned <- flights_lagged %>%\n  mutate(prev_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks=seq(-50, 500, by=10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE),\n            prev_delay = mean(prev_dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE),\n            n = n()) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_delay_bin), n > 25) # Remove small groups\n\nggplot(flights_binned, aes(x = prev_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs Previous Flight's Departure Delay\"\n  )\n```\n\n### **Explanation**\n\n- `arrange(year, month, day, dep_time)` makes sure flights are in temporal order.\n- `prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)` creates a column with previous row's `dep_delay`.\n- `cut()` bins previous delays, as exact values are noisy; change bin width as needed.\n- `group_by()` and `summarise()` calculate mean departure delay for each bin.\n- `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()` visualize the trend.\n\n---\n\n**Visualization insight:**  \nIf there's a temporal correlation, you'll see a positive trend: higher departure delays in the previous flight are associated with higher delays in the next.\n\nLet me know if you want to see it with raw points (not binned) or for a specific subset (like per carrier or airport)!",

      "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same\nairport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of\nJFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged\ndeparture delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly addresses the task of visualizing the temporal correlation of flight delays.\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\n1. **Issue with grouping**: The main issue is that the submission does not group by `origin` airport when creating the lagged variable. The criterion specifically mentions that \"the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`\" because delays at one airport shouldn't affect flights at another airport.\n\n2. **Handling NA values**: The submission does properly filter out NA values with `filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))`, which meets that part of the criterion.\n\n3. **Visualizing mean departure delay**: The first code snippet doesn't calculate the mean departure delay by lag value - it simply plots all individual departure delays against their previous flight delays. The second \"optional\" code snippet does calculate means using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, but it's still not grouped by origin.\n\n4. **Sorting**: The code sorts by `year, month, day, dep_time` which creates a temporal sequence, but this doesn't account for the need to consider only flights from the same airport.\n\nThe fundamental issue is that the submission misses the key insight that temporal correlation of delays should be examined within each airport separately. Without grouping by `origin` when creating the lagged variable, the analysis will incorrectly consider flights from different airports as sequential, which doesn't reflect the reality of how delays propagate.\n\nGRADE: P",

          "explanation": "I'll assess whether the submission meets the criterion.\n\nThe submission correctly addresses the main point of the task, which is to visualize the mean departure delay against the departure delay of the preceding flight. Let me analyze it against the criterion:\n\n1. **Grouping by origin**: The submission correctly recognizes that flights should be arranged and grouped by `origin` airport, as specified in the criterion. The code includes:\n```r\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, dep_time) %>%\n  group_by(origin) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n```\n\n2. **Handling of NA values**: The submission properly filters out rows with NA values:\n```r\nflights_clean <- flights_lagged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n```\n\n3. **Mean calculation**: The submission offers two approaches - one using binned data and one using a smoother. The binned approach correctly calculates mean departure delay by the binned lagged departure delay:\n```r\nflights_binned <- flights_clean %>%\n  mutate(bin = cut(dep_delay_lag, breaks = seq(-60, 300, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(bin) %>%\n  summarize(mean_dep_delay_lag = mean(dep_delay_lag),\n            mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),\n            n = n()) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(bin))\n```\n\n4. **Visualization**: The submission provides two visualization options that would both correctly show the relationship between current flight delay and previous flight delay.\n\nThe submission includes all the critical components mentioned in the criterion. It correctly groups by origin, handles NA values, and calculates mean departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay (though it offers binning as an option). The plots would properly visualize the relationship between current flight delay and previous flight delay.\n\nGRADE: C",

              "text": "Let's break down your problem:\n\n### **Key Points of Error**\n\n1. **HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed**  \n   This means **the server endpoint you are calling doesn't allow the HTTP method you are using**.\n\n2. **You're using `-X 'GET'` and a POST-style body**  \n   Your `curl` command specifies a `GET` request (`-X GET`) *and* a request body (`-d ...`), which is unusual: **GET requests should not have a body**. Most APIs will *reject* GET requests with a body, and many reverse proxies block them altogether.\n\n3. **Your R code (httr2) also sends a body (JSON) with implicit POST or GET**  \n   By default, if you attach a body via `req_body_json`, `httr2` will assume a `POST` request unless you override it.\n\n---\n\n## **How do you fix it?**\n\n### **Step 1: Check the API Docs**\n- Does the endpoint expect a `GET` or a `POST`[*]? If you are supposed to submit a JSON payload, **use POST**.\n\n[*]\\(Very rarely, APIs accept GET + body. It's considered best practice to use POST or, less commonly, PUT/PATCH/DELETE \\- depending on your use case.)\n\n### **Step 2: Correct the curl Command**\nIf it's POST:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n\nNotice `-X POST` instead of `-X GET`.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Fix the httr2 Syntax**\n\nMake sure you call `.req_method(\"POST\")` (or let it be the default, since a body usually triggers POST, but being explicit is better):\n\n#### **Full example**\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\none2 <- request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: If the API really expects GET, remove the body**\n\nSometimes, the API is designed to accept parameters as *query string* (in the URL), **not as a request body**.\n\nExample curl:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01\" \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n\nAnd in R (`httr2`):\n\n```r\none2 <- request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"GET\") %>%\n  req_headers(...your headers...) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal = \"2023-05-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **405 is because you're using GET with a body**, but the API doesn't accept that.\n- Double-check whether you should use GET with **query parameters** or POST with a **JSON body**.\n- Usually:  \n  - **GET = parameters in URL/query**  \n  - **POST = parameters in body (JSON)**\n\n---\n\n**If you tell me which API you're calling, or share its documentation, I can be more precise!**"

Most APIs will *reject* GET requests with a body, and many reverse proxies block them altogether.\n\n3. **Your R code (httr2) also sends a body (JSON) with implicit POST or GET**  \n   By default, if you attach a body via `req_body_json`, `httr2` will assume a `POST` request unless you override it.\n\n---\n\n## **How do you fix it?**\n\n### **Step 1: Check the API Docs**\n- Does the endpoint expect a `GET` or a `POST`[*]?

Some APIs are strict and will throw a 405 if you try to do this.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **How to fix it**\n\n#### **Option 1: Change method to POST (if the API supports it)**\n\nUsually when you send a body you use `POST`.  \n**Try this in Curl:**\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n**And in R (httr2):**\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n#### **Option 2: Move params to the URL (if the API only accepts GET)**\n\nYou can’t have a body with GET — so **move your parameters into the query string**, like this:\n\n**Curl:**\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01\" \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n\n**R httr2:**\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"GET\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\",\n    fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Summary**\n\n- **405 error** is because you used a body with a GET request.\n- **If the API expects a body**, use `POST` (or whatever method is supported for bodies).\n- **If the API expects query parameters**, use GET and put the parameters in the URL/query string.\n- **Check the API documentation** to see what method is expected.\n\n---\n\n**If you're still stuck, post the API documentation or more details here and I can help you further!**",

          "explanation": "I need to assess if the submission meets the criterion of adding `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer.\n\nLooking at the submission, the author provides two approaches to solve the problem of showing unused levels in the legend:\n\n1. The first approach adds a dummy row with NA values for the unused level, using:\n```r\ngeom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n2. The second approach adds a second transparent geom:\n```r\ngeom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\ngeom_point(\n  data = data.frame(x=0, y=0, z=factor(\"d\", levels=levels(df$z))),\n  aes(x=x, y=y, color=z),\n  alpha = 0\n)\n```\n\nNeither of these solutions includes `show.legend = TRUE` as specified in the criterion. While the submission provides working solutions to display the unused level in the legend, it doesn't specifically implement the exact approach requested in the criterion.\n\nIt's worth noting that `show.legend = TRUE` is actually the default in ggplot2, so the solutions would work without explicitly setting it.

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: Great question! By default, **ggplot2** only shows a symbol (such as a dot) for legend entries that are actually present in the data. For levels that are specified in your scale but **not actually in your data**, the legend entry appears without a glyph -- which can be visually confusing.\n\n**The short answer:**  \nYou need to **add at least one data point** (it can be invisible) with the unused level so that ggplot2 will render the point symbol for that level in the legend.\n\n**Here’s how you can do it:**\n\n### 1. Add a \"dummy\" point with the unused level\n\nAdd a row to your data frame with the \"unused\" level, and make its position outside the plotting area (or set its transparency to 0):\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\n# Add a dummy row for the unused level\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x=NA, y=NA, z=factor(\"d\", levels=levels(df$z))))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n**Note:**  \n- The `NA` coordinates with `na.rm=TRUE` mean the point is not plotted, but ggplot2 sees the factor level as \"used\" and puts a symbol in the legend.\n- Alternatively, you could use coordinates outside the plot window, such as `x = Inf`, or set alpha=0 for the dummy point for more control.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Fancier solution: Transparent dummy point\n\nIf you don’t want to mess with the main data, add a second invisible geom:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = data.frame(x=0, y=0, z=factor(\"d\", levels=levels(df$z))),\n    aes(x=x, y=y, color=z),\n    alpha = 0 # fully transparent\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n---\n\n### In summary\n\n**ggplot2 only draws symbols in legends for present levels; to force a symbol for an unused level, add a dummy observation for that level, either as a row in your data or through a separate, transparent `geom_point`.**\n\nThis is a common trick to \"force\" a legend entry to show as you wish!\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- [FAQ: Legend shows empty symbol for some factor levels](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/faq.html#legend-shows-empty-symbol-for-some-factor-levels) on the ggplot2 FAQ  \n- [Github discussion/example](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/938)\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Fancier solution: Transparent dummy point\n\nIf you don’t want to mess with the main data, add a second invisible geom:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = data.frame(x=0, y=0, z=factor(\"d\", levels=levels(df$z))),\n    aes(x=x, y=y, color=z),\n    alpha = 0 # fully transparent\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n---\n\n### In summary\n\n**ggplot2 only draws symbols in legends for present levels; to force a symbol for an unused level, add a dummy observation for that level, either as a row in your data or through a separate, transparent `geom_point`.**\n\nThis is a common trick to \"force\" a legend entry to show as you wish!\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- [FAQ: Legend shows empty symbol for some factor levels](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/faq.html#legend-shows-empty-symbol-for-some-factor-levels) on the ggplot2 FAQ  \n- [Github discussion/example](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/938)",

This causes ggplot2 to include the symbol for that level in the legend, with the assigned color.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you want an example for lines or filled shapes!**\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: You've got most of the code correct! The issue is that, by default, **ggplot2** does **not** draw a legend key for unused factor levels, so the \"d\" is included in the legend (as you want) but the key entry (\"dot\") is blank, indicating no data for that group.\n\n**If you want the legend for \"d\" to look the same as the legend for observed data (i.e., have a green dot),** you need to \"trick\" ggplot into thinking there are *some* data points with that level, _without actually plotting them on the main panel_.\n\n## Solution 1: Add an invisible row\n\nAdd a dummy row for level _d_ that is placed outside the plot area so it doesn’t appear, but triggers the correct legend key:\n\n```r\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nThis will produce a legend where the entry for \"d\" has a green dot, just like the others.\n\n- The `na.rm = TRUE` in `geom_point()` is important in case you use `NA` values to generate the legend key.\n\n---\n\n## Solution 2: Add a dummy point outside the range\n\nAlternatively, use a value far outside the plot range:\n\n```r\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = Inf, y = Inf, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nNo point \"d\" is visible, but the legend shows the green dot.\n\n---\n\n## Notes:\n\n- This approach is idiomatic in ggplot2 for ensuring a legend key for unused levels.\n- If you have multiple unused levels, you'll want corresponding dummy rows for each.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou must add a dummy/fake data point for the unused factor level to get the corresponding color key (\"dot\") in the legend, as ggplot2 will only plot a symbol for levels that appear in the data.\n\n---\n\n### Full Example\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE, show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nNow your legend will have a colored dot for \"d\"!\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

                  "text": "You've got most of the code correct! The issue is that, by default, **ggplot2** does **not** draw a legend key for unused factor levels, so the \"d\" is included in the legend (as you want) but the key entry (\"dot\") is blank, indicating no data for that group.\n\n**If you want the legend for \"d\" to look the same as the legend for observed data (i.e., have a green dot),** you need to \"trick\" ggplot into thinking there are *some* data points with that level, _without actually plotting them on the main panel_.\n\n## Solution 1: Add an invisible row\n\nAdd a dummy row for level _d_ that is placed outside the plot area so it doesn’t appear, but triggers the correct legend key:\n\n```r\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nThis will produce a legend where the entry for \"d\" has a green dot, just like the others.\n\n- The `na.rm = TRUE` in `geom_point()` is important in case you use `NA` values to generate the legend key.\n\n---\n\n## Solution 2: Add a dummy point outside the range\n\nAlternatively, use a value far outside the plot range:\n\n```r\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = Inf, y = Inf, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nNo point \"d\" is visible, but the legend shows the green dot.\n\n---\n\n## Notes:\n\n- This approach is idiomatic in ggplot2 for ensuring a legend key for unused levels.\n- If you have multiple unused levels, you'll want corresponding dummy rows for each.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou must add a dummy/fake data point for the unused factor level to get the corresponding color key (\"dot\") in the legend, as ggplot2 will only plot a symbol for levels that appear in the data.\n\n---\n\n### Full Example\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE, show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nNow your legend will have a colored dot for \"d\"!",

When you build a URL with spaces and special characters (like `\"Prince st., New York 10012\"`), it needs to be properly encoded (spaces become `%20`, commas become `%2C`, etc.), otherwise the URL is malformed and the request will fail.\n\n`glue::glue()` does not URL-encode values. You need to explicitly encode the parameters with `utils::URLencode()` (or, in `httr2`, use query parameter helpers).\n\n**Solution 1: Use `httr2::url_build()` with query list**\n\nYou do NOT need to manually build and encode the URL. Instead, use the url/query helper:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\nbase_url <- \"https://geocode.maps.co/search\"\n\nreq <- request(base_url) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    q = address,\n    api_key = api_key\n  )\nresp <- req_perform(req)\njson <- resp_body_json(resp)\nprint(json)\n```\n\n**Solution 2: Manual encoding (less recommended, but possible)**\n\nIf you insist on building the url string yourself, encode the address:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\nencoded_address <- utils::URLencode(address, reserved = TRUE)\nurl <- glue::glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={encoded_address}&api_key={api_key}\")\nresponse <- httr2::request(url) %>%   \n  httr2::req_perform()\n```\n\n**Summary**\n\n- **DO NOT** pass unsafe characters directly in the URL.\n- **DO** use helpers to set query parameters, **or** encode them with `URLencode()`.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe `httr2::req_url_query()` approach is clearer and avoids manual mistakes. Use that unless you have a strong reason otherwise!\n***\n[Criterion]: Format the address to result in a valid URL by replacing spaces and, likely,\nremoving punctuation. Something like:\n\n```\naddress <- \"Prince+st+New+York+10012\"\n```\n\nIt would also be correct to pass the URL with the existing `address` to\n`URLencode()` or `url_encode()`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The criterion specifically states that \"no persistent summarization across rows should happen\" in the first filtering step, but the submission performs summarization first.\n\nThe criterion also notes that `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` is the correct way to calculate the proportion of NA values, which the submission does correctly use.\n\nGRADE: P",

          "explanation": "I need to analyze whether the submission meets the criterion which describes a three-step process: grouped filtering, grouped summarizing, and arranging.\n\nThe submitted code uses:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n_flights = n(),\n    n_NA = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_NA = n_NA / n_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_NA)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(tailnum, prop_NA, n_flights)\n```\n\nHere's where the submission differs from the criterion:\n\n1. **Filtering approach**: The criterion states we should first filter to only keep rows where each tailnum has > 100 flights, using something like `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)` or `group_by(tailnum) %>% filter(n() > 100)`. Instead, the submission calculates the number of flights first and then filters after summarizing.\n\n2. **Calculation method**: The submission correctly identifies that we need to calculate the proportion of NA values in arr_delay, but uses `prop_NA = n_NA / n_flights` (with `n_NA = sum(is.na(arr_delay))`) rather than directly using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` as specified in the criterion. While mathematically equivalent, it's not following the exact approach required.\n\n3. **Order of operations**: The criterion wants filtering before summarization, but the submission does summarization first, then filtering.\n\nWhile the submission would produce the correct result (the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays among those with at least 100 flights), it doesn't follow the required workflow steps in the specified order.\n\nGRADE: P",

While mathematically equivalent, it's not following the exact approach required.\n\n3. **Order of operations**: The criterion wants filtering before summarization, but the submission does summarization first, then filtering.\n\nWhile the submission would produce the correct result (the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays among those with at least 100 flights), it doesn't follow the required workflow steps in the specified order.\n\nGRADE: P",

The `.by` argument (note the dot: `.by`, not just `by`) was introduced more recently and only in some tidyverse functions (notably in `{dplyr}` >=1.1.0).\n\n### What's going on?\n\n- **`mutate()` does not have a `by` argument!**\n  - If you want to apply `mutate()` \"by group\", the usual method is to use `group_by()` then `mutate()`.\n  - Some functions in new dplyr releases support `mutate(.by = ...)`, but you must use **`.by`**, not `by`, and ensure you have recently updated dplyr.\n\n---\n\n### How to fix:\n\n#### **Option 1: Classic way (works with all dplyr versions)**\n```r\ndf %>%\n  group_by(id, date) %>%\n  mutate(new_var = ...) %>%\n  ungroup()\n```\n- This will perform the `mutate()` per group of `id, date`.\n\n#### **Option 2: Modern way (dplyr >= 1.1.0)**\n- If you have a modern dplyr version (**>= 1.1.0**), you can use `.by = ...` inside `mutate()`:\n```r\ndf %>%\n  mutate(new_var = ..., .by = c(id, date))\n```\n- **Important:** `.by`, not `by`.\n\n\n---\n\n### Why the error?\n\nThe error says:\n> `by` must be size 2909492 or 1, not 5818984.\n\nThat is, something is **recycling** incorrectly.

While the proposed solution works (setting a default of NULL and handling it in the function body), it's not exactly the approach specified in the criterion which emphasizes forcing early evaluation rather than redesigning the default argument.\n\nThe submission gives a working solution but doesn't address the criterion's specific suggested approach of forcing evaluation.\n\nGRADE: P"

The submission initially suggests that naming the argument is the problem, but then demonstrates that this actually works fine in a minimal example. \n\nThe submission gets closer to the real issue when it mentions:\n- \"it's likely because something else in your code is evaluating the default for `name` after `dataset` is evaluated\"\n- \"do not reference or force `dataset` before `name` is set\"\n\nThese explanations hint at the lazy evaluation issue mentioned in the criterion, but the submission doesn't explicitly mention lazy evaluation as the core problem. \n\nThe key insight from the criterion is that `name` must be evaluated early using `force(name)`, but the submission doesn't mention this solution at all. Instead, it proposes alternative solutions:\n1. Setting the default in the body using `if (missing(name))`\n2. Using `if (is.null(name))` with a default of `NULL`\n\nWhile these are valid workarounds that accomplish similar goals, they don't directly address the lazy evaluation issue as specified in the criterion. The submission doesn't suggest using `force(name)` early in the function body, which is the specific solution the criterion is looking for.\n\nGRADE: P",

When you write:\n\n```r\ntsk <- task_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n```\n\nYou want `deparse(substitute(dataset))` to give `\"simple_addition\"`, and it normally does.\n\n**But**—it sounds like you're getting the *value* instead, which suggests that something inside your function is evaluating the symbol before calling `deparse(substitute(dataset))`.\n\n#### Minimal Repro:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = deparse(substitute(dataset))\n) {\n  print(name)\n}\nsimple_addition <- tibble::tibble(\n  input = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\", \"5\")\n)\n\ntask_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n# [1] \"simple_addition\"\n```\n\nThis works as expected.\n\n#### If you are doing something like this:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = deparse(substitute(dataset)),\n    dir = \"foo\"\n) {\n  print(name)\n  # ...other code that maybe uses substitute(dataset), eval, etc...\n}\n```\n\nand get a *long printed value*, it's likely because something else in your code is evaluating the default for `name` _after_ `dataset` is evaluated.\n\n### **Common mistake:**\n\nIf you use `match.call()` and extract the argument, you might get an expression like `dataset = simple_addition`, which can further confuse things.\n\n### **How to Fix Robustly**\n\nMake sure:\n  - The `name` default is `deparse(substitute(dataset))` **at the top level of the function**.\n  - You do not reference or force `dataset` before `name` is set.\n\nFull Example:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = deparse(substitute(dataset)),\n    dir = \"foo\"\n) {\n  print(name)\n}\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nsimple_addition <- tibble(\n  input = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\", \"5\")\n)\ntask_create(simple_addition)\ntask_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n```\n\nBoth return `[1] \"simple_addition\"`.\n\n#### **If you still get the full value, your code may be doing this:**\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = deparse(substitute(dataset)),\n    dir = \"foo\"\n) {\n  dataset # evaluates `dataset`, which may cause the match.call/substitute/.. to evaluate unexpectedly\n  print(name)\n}\n```\n\nSo, **do not use** `dataset` _before_ `name` is set.\n\n### **If you want to be absolutely safe:**\n\nSet the default in the body:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name, dir = \"foo\") {\n  if (missing(name)) name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  print(name)\n}\n```\n\nThis always works, regardless of how the arguments are called or evaluated.\n\n### **TL;DR**\n\n- Use `name = deparse(substitute(dataset))` as a default, and do **not** access `dataset` before `name` is set.\n- Or, make `name` default `NULL` and set it in the function body, using `deparse(substitute(dataset))` if `name` is missing.\n\n**Most robust pattern:**\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name = NULL, dir = \"foo\") {\n  if (is.null(name)) name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  print(name)\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary table:**\n\n| Pattern                   | Safe?         | Notes                                      |\n|---------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| param default             | Sometimes     | Only if referencing `dataset` comes after   |\n| `missing()` in body       | Yes           | Most robust                                 |\n| Access dataset before name| No            | Breaks default expression                   |\n\n---\n\n### **So, just use:**\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name = NULL, dir = \"foo\") {\n  if (is.null(name)) name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  print(name)\n}\n```\n\nThis will reliably print \"simple_addition\" in your example."

If you call `NS(id)`, you get wrong (extra) double namespacing.\n\n### The fix:\n\n**1.

So the full output ids for your nested module will be things like `outer1-inner1-theGeneratedUI`, etc.\n- **Server side:** You call `innerServer(\"inner1\")`, which is correct: you want the server to attach to IDs like `outer1-inner1`.\n\nBut **within your module's server** (i.e., `innerServer`), you're doing:\n\n```r\nns <- NS(id)\n...\noutput$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n  tagList(\n    h5(...),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n    plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n  )\n})\n```\n\nThis **looks correct**, because you are using `ns` on `someTextGenerated` and `theChart` output IDs...\n\nBut **the dynamically generated UI is created inside `renderUI`**, so when Shiny tries to resolve those IDs in the page, it can have problems *matching them to the outputs being produced* (e.g. `output$someTextGenerated`). In practice, this can happen because the output binding resolution doesn't always work well when the UI is generated *after* the output binding has been set up.\n\n**The solution:**  \nUse the session's `ns` (not `NS(id)`) in your module server, and _make sure the `output` objects are created at the same namespace as that used in the dynamic UI._ If you use `session$ns` and call `moduleServer(id, ...)`, then all your output IDs will match as expected, both inside the static and dynamically rendered UI.\n\n---\n\n## The fix\n\nUse `session$ns` everywhere in your module's server, rather than re-creating it with `NS(id)`.  \nHere's a working, minimal fixed example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns    # *** Use session$ns for consistent namespacing ***\n    \n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    \n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    \n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    \n    # *** Use ns() inside renderUI as well ***\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns    # not strictly needed here but for consistency\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner2\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner3\"))\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- Use `session$ns` **(not `NS(id)`)** inside module servers.\n- Call child modules in servers with fully namespaced IDs (`ns(\"inner1\")`), and use the correct namespacing in their UIs.\n- That's it!

So the full output ids for your nested module will be things like `outer1-inner1-theGeneratedUI`, etc.\n- **Server side:** You call `innerServer(\"inner1\")`, which is correct: you want the server to attach to IDs like `outer1-inner1`.\n\nBut **within your module's server** (i.e., `innerServer`), you're doing:\n\n```r\nns <- NS(id)\n...\noutput$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n  tagList(\n    h5(...),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n    plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n  )\n})\n```\n\nThis **looks correct**, because you are using `ns` on `someTextGenerated` and `theChart` output IDs...\n\nBut **the dynamically generated UI is created inside `renderUI`**, so when Shiny tries to resolve those IDs in the page, it can have problems *matching them to the outputs being produced* (e.g. `output$someTextGenerated`). In practice, this can happen because the output binding resolution doesn't always work well when the UI is generated *after* the output binding has been set up.\n\n**The solution:**  \nUse the session's `ns` (not `NS(id)`) in your module server, and _make sure the `output` objects are created at the same namespace as that used in the dynamic UI._ If you use `session$ns` and call `moduleServer(id, ...)`, then all your output IDs will match as expected, both inside the static and dynamically rendered UI.\n\n---\n\n## The fix\n\nUse `session$ns` everywhere in your module's server, rather than re-creating it with `NS(id)`.  \nHere's a working, minimal fixed example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns    # *** Use session$ns for consistent namespacing ***\n    \n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    \n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    \n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    \n    # *** Use ns() inside renderUI as well ***\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns    # not strictly needed here but for consistency\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner2\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner3\"))\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- Use `session$ns` **(not `NS(id)`)** inside module servers.\n- Call child modules in servers with fully namespaced IDs (`ns(\"inner1\")`), and use the correct namespacing in their UIs.\n- That's it!

So the full output ids for your nested module will be things like `outer1-inner1-theGeneratedUI`, etc.\n- **Server side:** You call `innerServer(\"inner1\")`, which is correct: you want the server to attach to IDs like `outer1-inner1`.\n\nBut **within your module's server** (i.e., `innerServer`), you're doing:\n\n```r\nns <- NS(id)\n...\noutput$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n  tagList(\n    h5(...),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n    plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n  )\n})\n```\n\nThis **looks correct**, because you are using `ns` on `someTextGenerated` and `theChart` output IDs...\n\nBut **the dynamically generated UI is created inside `renderUI`**, so when Shiny tries to resolve those IDs in the page, it can have problems *matching them to the outputs being produced* (e.g. `output$someTextGenerated`). In practice, this can happen because the output binding resolution doesn't always work well when the UI is generated *after* the output binding has been set up.\n\n**The solution:**  \nUse the session's `ns` (not `NS(id)`) in your module server, and _make sure the `output` objects are created at the same namespace as that used in the dynamic UI._ If you use `session$ns` and call `moduleServer(id, ...)`, then all your output IDs will match as expected, both inside the static and dynamically rendered UI.\n\n---\n\n## The fix\n\nUse `session$ns` everywhere in your module's server, rather than re-creating it with `NS(id)`.  \nHere's a working, minimal fixed example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns    # *** Use session$ns for consistent namespacing ***\n    \n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    \n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    \n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    \n    # *** Use ns() inside renderUI as well ***\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns    # not strictly needed here but for consistency\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner2\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner3\"))\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- Use `session$ns` **(not `NS(id)`)** inside module servers.\n- Call child modules in servers with fully namespaced IDs (`ns(\"inner1\")`), and use the correct namespacing in their UIs.\n- That's it! Now your dynamically generated outputs will work.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ **One more tip:** If you want reproducible results for the plot across multiple reruns, set a seed in your plot code. (Not necessary for your example, but sometimes unexpected randomness can obscure debugging.)"

In practice, this can happen because the output binding resolution doesn't always work well when the UI is generated *after* the output binding has been set up.\n\n**The solution:**  \nUse the session's `ns` (not `NS(id)`) in your module server, and _make sure the `output` objects are created at the same namespace as that used in the dynamic UI._ If you use `session$ns` and call `moduleServer(id, ...)`, then all your output IDs will match as expected, both inside the static and dynamically rendered UI.\n\n---\n\n## The fix\n\nUse `session$ns` everywhere in your module's server, rather than re-creating it with `NS(id)`.  \nHere's a working, minimal fixed example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns    # *** Use session$ns for consistent namespacing ***\n    \n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    \n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    \n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    \n    # *** Use ns() inside renderUI as well ***\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns    # not strictly needed here but for consistency\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner2\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner3\"))\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- Use `session$ns` **(not `NS(id)`)** inside module servers.\n- Call child modules in servers with fully namespaced IDs (`ns(\"inner1\")`), and use the correct namespacing in their UIs.\n- That's it! Now your dynamically generated outputs will work.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ **One more tip:** If you want reproducible results for the plot across multiple reruns, set a seed in your plot code. (Not necessary for your example, but sometimes unexpected randomness can obscure debugging.)",

              "text": "This is a subtle issue that often comes up when using GitHub dependencies in R, especially when the **repository name** on GitHub does not exactly match the package name as listed in the package's **DESCRIPTION**.\n\n### What's Happening\n\n- **Your package**: Imports `spatialstuff`, in DESCRIPTION as `spatialstuff`\n- **Remotes**: points to `org/spatial-Stuff` on GitHub\n- **The repo**: The **GitHub repository** is called `spatial-Stuff` (capital \"S\", and with a \"-\")\n- **The package itself (in that repo)**: Presumably called `\"spatialstuff\"` in its DESCRIPTION\n\n#### When `pak` (or remotes, or devtools) tries to install\n\n- It looks for the **R package name** (as in the package's DESCRIPTION: `Package: spatialstuff`), **not** the repo name.\n- In `Remotes`, `org/spatial-Stuff` means \"on org's GitHub, look for repo 'spatial-Stuff', and install whatever R package it finds inside.\"\n\n### Error Analysis\n\nThe error:\n\n```\nCould not solve package dependencies:\ndeps::.: Can't install dependency spatialstuff\n* spatialstuff: Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n```\n\nThis implies `pak` couldn't find a package called `spatialstuff`.\n\n1. **Is the repo truly public?** (if it's private, workflow can't install)\n2. **What is the name in the target repo's DESCRIPTION?**  \n   - It **must** be `Package: spatialstuff`\n   - The capitalization **must** match your `Imports` in DESCRIPTION and how you call it in code.\n3. **Does remote actually resolve to the package?**\n   - Maybe the package doesn't build or isn't in the root.\n   - Maybe the repo does not contain a DESCRIPTION at its root.\n\n### What Commonly Goes Wrong Here\n\n- If the GitHub repo contains a package with a name **different** from the repo name, the `Remotes:` entry must **exactly** match the repo as a `user/repo`.\n- **But elsewhere, including Imports, only use the PACKAGE name**\n- **Case sensitivity:** Package names in R are (mostly) case-insensitive (for loading), but the actual package name in `DESCRIPTION` should be all lower case by convention. However, some tools may be picky.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| In DESCRIPTION         | Should be             |\n|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Imports:               | spatialstuff         |\n| Remotes:               | org/spatial-Stuff    |\n\nAnd:  \n- The repo `org/spatial-Stuff` must have a `DESCRIPTION` with `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n### Why might your workflow fail?\n\n- **If the repo `org/spatial-Stuff` does NOT have in its DESCRIPTION:**  \n  `Package: spatialstuff`  \n  (e.g. if it says `Package: spatial-Stuff`), then R will not recognize it as providing `spatialstuff`.\n- **If it's private**, GitHub Actions can't install unless you provide a token.\n- If the repo's `DESCRIPTION` or overall structure is broken, `pak` can't install.\n\n### How to Debug\n\n1. **Check the other package's DESCRIPTION**\n   - Look for `Package: <something>`\n   - It must say `spatialstuff`, not `spatial-Stuff` or `Spatialstuff` etc.\n\n2. **Clone the repo and try locally:**\n   ```r\n   pak::pak(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n   ```\n   and see what happens.\n\n3. **If you don't control the upstram**: and the repo says `Package: spatial-Stuff`, *then you must*:\n   - Import `spatial-Stuff` (not valid R package name unless you used `-` in the package name, which is not valid!).\n   - But this will not work, because R packages can't have \"-\"s in their names!\n   - The repo **must** have a valid R package name in DESCRIPTION.\n\n### How To Fix\n\n- **If the issue is the package name** in `org/spatial-Stuff`'s DESCRIPTION file (e.g. `Package: spatial-Stuff` or something not matching `spatialstuff`), **there is no way around this unless you fix that repo** so that its DESCRIPTION file says `Package: spatialstuff` (all lowercase, no dash).\n\n- **If the package is properly named**, and `pak::pak(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")` works locally but fails in CI, ensure the repo is public or give the workflow access to a token.\n\n### TLDR Answer\n\n**This error occurs because `pak` cannot find a package called `spatialstuff` (all lowercase) from your specified source.**  \n- **Most likely cause:** The `DESCRIPTION` file in the repo at `org/spatial-Stuff` does not declare the package as `Package: spatialstuff`.\n- **To fix:** The DESCRIPTION in that repo must have `Package: spatialstuff` to match your Imports line.\n- **Alternatively**: If you don't control the upstream and the package is misnamed (e.g. uppercase or dash), you can't use it reliably in your package's Imports.\n\n---\n\n#### Summary\n\n- Check package name in the *repo's* DESCRIPTION.\n- It must be all lowercase, no dash: `Package: spatialstuff`.\n- Your Imports should be exactly that: `spatialstuff`\n- Your Remotes should be: `org/spatial-Stuff`\n- If the repo's package name does not match, **this is not your error, but an issue with the upstream package.**\n- On your end, you did nothing wrong (\"user error\": **not your fault unless the repo is private/unreachable**).\n\n---\n\n**If you need to show the upstream maintainer the correct practice:**\n- The R package name in DESCRIPTION **must match** what's used as the package name in other projects' Imports.\n- The repo name on GitHub doesn't matter (except in the Remotes: line).\n\n---\n\nIf you want to check the github package name directly, you can run:\n```r\ndesc::desc(\"https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\nin R (with the `desc` package). That will print the DESCRIPTION, and the first line is the true package name.\n\n**Let me know if you want help interpreting the DESCRIPTION or have clarifications!**"

However, some tools may be picky.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| In DESCRIPTION         | Should be             |\n|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Imports:               | spatialstuff         |\n| Remotes:               | org/spatial-Stuff    |\n\nAnd:  \n- The repo `org/spatial-Stuff` must have a `DESCRIPTION` with `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n### Why might your workflow fail?\n\n- **If the repo `org/spatial-Stuff` does NOT have in its DESCRIPTION:**  \n  `Package: spatialstuff`  \n  (e.g. if it says `Package: spatial-Stuff`), then R will not recognize it as providing `spatialstuff`.\n- **If it's private**, GitHub Actions can't install unless you provide a token.\n- If the repo's `DESCRIPTION` or overall structure is broken, `pak` can't install.\n\n### How to Debug\n\n1. **Check the other package's DESCRIPTION**\n   - Look for `Package: <something>`\n   - It must say `spatialstuff`, not `spatial-Stuff` or `Spatialstuff` etc.\n\n2. **Clone the repo and try locally:**\n   ```r\n   pak::pak(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n   ```\n   and see what happens.\n\n3. **If you don't control the upstram**: and the repo says `Package: spatial-Stuff`, *then you must*:\n   - Import `spatial-Stuff` (not valid R package name unless you used `-` in the package name, which is not valid!).\n   - But this will not work, because R packages can't have \"-\"s in their names!\n   - The repo **must** have a valid R package name in DESCRIPTION.\n\n### How To Fix\n\n- **If the issue is the package name** in `org/spatial-Stuff`'s DESCRIPTION file (e.g. `Package: spatial-Stuff` or something not matching `spatialstuff`), **there is no way around this unless you fix that repo** so that its DESCRIPTION file says `Package: spatialstuff` (all lowercase, no dash).\n\n- **If the package is properly named**, and `pak::pak(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")` works locally but fails in CI, ensure the repo is public or give the workflow access to a token.\n\n### TLDR Answer\n\n**This error occurs because `pak` cannot find a package called `spatialstuff` (all lowercase) from your specified source.**  \n- **Most likely cause:** The `DESCRIPTION` file in the repo at `org/spatial-Stuff` does not declare the package as `Package: spatialstuff`.\n- **To fix:** The DESCRIPTION in that repo must have `Package: spatialstuff` to match your Imports line.\n- **Alternatively**: If you don't control the upstream and the package is misnamed (e.g. uppercase or dash), you can't use it reliably in your package's Imports.\n\n---\n\n#### Summary\n\n- Check package name in the *repo's* DESCRIPTION.\n- It must be all lowercase, no dash: `Package: spatialstuff`.\n- Your Imports should be exactly that: `spatialstuff`\n- Your Remotes should be: `org/spatial-Stuff`\n- If the repo's package name does not match, **this is not your error, but an issue with the upstream package.**\n- On your end, you did nothing wrong (\"user error\": **not your fault unless the repo is private/unreachable**).\n\n---\n\n**If you need to show the upstream maintainer the correct practice:**\n- The R package name in DESCRIPTION **must match** what's used as the package name in other projects' Imports.\n- The repo name on GitHub doesn't matter (except in the Remotes: line).\n\n---\n\nIf you want to check the github package name directly, you can run:\n```r\ndesc::desc(\"https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\nin R (with the `desc` package). That will print the DESCRIPTION, and the first line is the true package name.\n\n**Let me know if you want help interpreting the DESCRIPTION or have clarifications!**\n***\n[Criterion]: The user needs to specify the package name explicitly in the Remotes `DESCRIPTION` field using a `<package>=` prefix, e.g. `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff`.\n\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

However, some tools may be picky.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| In DESCRIPTION         | Should be             |\n|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Imports:               | spatialstuff         |\n| Remotes:               | org/spatial-Stuff    |\n\nAnd:  \n- The repo `org/spatial-Stuff` must have a `DESCRIPTION` with `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n### Why might your workflow fail?\n\n- **If the repo `org/spatial-Stuff` does NOT have in its DESCRIPTION:**  \n  `Package: spatialstuff`  \n  (e.g. if it says `Package: spatial-Stuff`), then R will not recognize it as providing `spatialstuff`.\n- **If it's private**, GitHub Actions can't install unless you provide a token.\n- If the repo's `DESCRIPTION` or overall structure is broken, `pak` can't install.\n\n### How to Debug\n\n1. **Check the other package's DESCRIPTION**\n   - Look for `Package: <something>`\n   - It must say `spatialstuff`, not `spatial-Stuff` or `Spatialstuff` etc.\n\n2. **Clone the repo and try locally:**\n   ```r\n   pak::pak(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n   ```\n   and see what happens.\n\n3. **If you don't control the upstram**: and the repo says `Package: spatial-Stuff`, *then you must*:\n   - Import `spatial-Stuff` (not valid R package name unless you used `-` in the package name, which is not valid!).\n   - But this will not work, because R packages can't have \"-\"s in their names!\n   - The repo **must** have a valid R package name in DESCRIPTION.\n\n### How To Fix\n\n- **If the issue is the package name** in `org/spatial-Stuff`'s DESCRIPTION file (e.g. `Package: spatial-Stuff` or something not matching `spatialstuff`), **there is no way around this unless you fix that repo** so that its DESCRIPTION file says `Package: spatialstuff` (all lowercase, no dash).\n\n- **If the package is properly named**, and `pak::pak(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")` works locally but fails in CI, ensure the repo is public or give the workflow access to a token.\n\n### TLDR Answer\n\n**This error occurs because `pak` cannot find a package called `spatialstuff` (all lowercase) from your specified source.**  \n- **Most likely cause:** The `DESCRIPTION` file in the repo at `org/spatial-Stuff` does not declare the package as `Package: spatialstuff`.\n- **To fix:** The DESCRIPTION in that repo must have `Package: spatialstuff` to match your Imports line.\n- **Alternatively**: If you don't control the upstream and the package is misnamed (e.g. uppercase or dash), you can't use it reliably in your package's Imports.\n\n---\n\n#### Summary\n\n- Check package name in the *repo's* DESCRIPTION.\n- It must be all lowercase, no dash: `Package: spatialstuff`.\n- Your Imports should be exactly that: `spatialstuff`\n- Your Remotes should be: `org/spatial-Stuff`\n- If the repo's package name does not match, **this is not your error, but an issue with the upstream package.**\n- On your end, you did nothing wrong (\"user error\": **not your fault unless the repo is private/unreachable**).\n\n---\n\n**If you need to show the upstream maintainer the correct practice:**\n- The R package name in DESCRIPTION **must match** what's used as the package name in other projects' Imports.\n- The repo name on GitHub doesn't matter (except in the Remotes: line).\n\n---\n\nIf you want to check the github package name directly, you can run:\n```r\ndesc::desc(\"https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\nin R (with the `desc` package). That will print the DESCRIPTION, and the first line is the true package name.\n\n**Let me know if you want help interpreting the DESCRIPTION or have clarifications!**",

However, they miss the specific criterion required: using the `<package>=` prefix syntax in the Remotes field.\n\nThe submission suggests:\n```\nRemotes: org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nBut according to the criterion, the correct syntax should be:\n```\nRemotes: spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThis is a critical omission. The `<package>=` prefix explicitly maps the package name to the GitHub repository, which is essential when the package name differs from what might be inferred from the repository name. The solutions provided (using remotes instead of pak, or pre-installing the dependency) might work in some cases, but they don't address the fundamental issue specified in the criterion.\n\nThe submission fails to identify this specific syntax requirement, which is the key solution to the problem according to the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

In most setups (including `remotes::install_deps()`), your config works.\n2. **But:** \n    - The GHA workflow (`pkgdown.yaml`) may use `pak` (not `remotes` or `devtools`).\n    - `pak` can be _stricter_ or may not parse Remotes the same way, especially if it cannot resolve a dependency’s name from an unconventional remote, or there’s a cache/conflict.\n\n---\n\n## Solutions\n\n### **Solution 1: Use `Additional_repositories`** (if using drat or similar):\nDoes not apply here—your package isn’t in a drat repo.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 2: Use full Remotes syntax** (`Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff`)\nYou already did this!\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 3: Make sure your workflow uses `remotes` (not `pak`) to install**  \n- Look at your GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml`).\n- The step will look like this by default:\n\n  ```yaml\n  - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2\n    with:\n      extra-packages: any::pkgdown, any::rcmdcheck\n      cache-version: 1\n  ```\n\n- **By default**, this uses `pak` (`r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies` uses `pak`).\n\n- If you want, you can tell it to use `remotes` instead:\n\n  ```yaml\n  - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2\n    with:\n      extra-packages: any::pkgdown, any::rcmdcheck\n      package-manager: \"remotes\"\n  ```\n\n  This often resolves \"can't find custom Remotes package\" errors (as `remotes` is more tolerant of custom Remotes).\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 4: Try `pak` workaround with explicit remote refs**\n\nIf you must use `pak`, try listing the GitHub ref _explicitly_ in a step before the rest of your dependencies, e.g.:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2\n  with:\n    extra-packages: org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThis ensures the custom remote is installed _before_ the rest, so it’s available for `pak` resolution.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Fix method                    | Advantages           | Downsides         |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Use `remotes` in GHA (see above)      | Solves custom Remotes | Slightly slower/older solver |\n| Install the custom remote _before_    | Solves 95% of issues  | More manual, less DRY        |\n| Only use CRAN packages!              | Simple               | Not possible here             |\n\n---\n\n## **In summary**\n\n**You did NOT make a user error** in DESCRIPTION.  \nThe error is from how `pak` (in automated `pkgdown` builds) tries to resolve dependencies, and how Remotes are handled—sometimes imperfectly—especially with case-sensitive GitHub repo/package names.\n\n### **Action:**\n- **Either** tell `setup-r-dependencies` to use `remotes` (see \"Solution 3\" above),  \n- **Or** add a step to install `org/spatial-Stuff` before installing dependencies.\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies documentation](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/setup-r-dependencies)\n- [pak dependency solving and remotes](https://pak.r-lib.org/)\n- [GitHub repo names are case sensitive: FAQ](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/accessing-a-repository#case-sensitivity)\n- [r-pkgs: Nonstandard packages](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html#nonstandard-packages)\n\n---\n\n**If you want a copy-paste solution, post your pkgdown.yaml and your full DESCRIPTION, and I can show you exactly what to patch.**"

Only dynamically assigned methods are allowed.\nBut you then lose the ability to use R6's normal inheritance and `super`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Why does the error occur?\n\n- When you define a method in the public list, R6 creates an active (locked) binding for `foo` on each instance.\n- Later, in `initialize`, `self[[\"foo\"]] <- ...` tries to **overwrite** that binding, which is not allowed.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR: \n\n- **If you want a method to be overridden, always define it in the `public` list, NOT dynamically via `self`.**\n\n**Change your Parent class as follows:**\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      # initialization logic, but don't redefine foo here!\n    },\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n```\nNow subclassing will work as expected.\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY TABLE\n\n| Method Defined In:      | Overridable in Subclass? | Locked Binding Issue? |\n|------------------------|:------------------------:|:---------------------:|\n| public = list(foo=...) | YES                      | NO                    |\n| `initialize` via `self`| NO                       | YES (if also in public) |\n\n---\n\n### Extra References\n\nSee [R6 documentation: Inheritance](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html#inheritance) and [R6 FAQ: Overriding Methods](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/faq.html#how-can-i-override-a-method-in-a-subclass).\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n> **Don't assign to `self$foo` inside `initialize` if you want it to be overridable. Define all overridable methods in the public list.**",

Instead, plan your methods statically:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n      print('... and child')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n# foo\n# ... and child\n```\n\n### Solution 2: If you must assign methods dynamically\n\nIf your class genuinely requires adding methods at runtime, you **cannot override them using the subclass `public` list**. You'd have to use other techniques (e.g., assign to `self[[\"foo\"]]` in the subclass's `initialize` too), but that breaks the usual OOP patterns and is **not recommended** for base class methods you plan to override.\n\n**But generally: keep all planned overridable methods in the `public` list** at class definition time.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- **Define all overridable methods in the `public` list**, so that R6's `super` and inherit mechanisms work.\n- **Avoid overwriting public methods using `self[[\"foo\"]]` at runtime** if inheriting/overriding is needed.\n\n---\n\n**Reference:**  \n> The documentation for `lock_objects` and R6's method locking:  \n> https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR:\n\nChange your class definitions to:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() print('foo')\n  )\n)\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() super$foo()\n  )\n)\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n```\n\nAnd it will work!"

Here's what's happening, *why you're getting the error*, and **how to work around it**.\n\n---\n\n## What's Going On?\n\n1. **You dynamically assign** `foo` onto each `Parent`/`Child` instance in `initialize()`:\n   ```r\n   self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() { ... }\n   ```\n2. **You statically define** `foo` in `Child`'s `public` list.\n3. **R6 objects by default lock their members** (unless `lock_objects = FALSE`, which you set).\n\nBUT:  \nWhen you assign `self[[\"foo\"]]` in `initialize`, you're assigning to an **already-defined `foo`** in the parent or child class, and R6's internal locking/binding system gets confused:  \n- It tries to create a new `foo` (dynamic at runtime) on an object where `foo` may already exist in the public list (static at class definition time).\n- When `Child` calls `initialize` from the parent, it attempts to re-assign `foo` on a locked binding.\n\n---\n\n## The Root Problem\n\nYou are mixing:\n- Dynamic method creation (`self[[\"foo\"]] <- ...` in `initialize`)\n- With static method *overwriting* (`foo = function()` in `public`)\n\nThis **confuses the R6 binding mechanism**.\n\n---\n\n## How To Solve It\n\n### **Solution 1: Define methods statically only**\n\n#### **Don't assign methods dynamically.**  \nInstead, just define `foo` in the parent class's `public` list:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()   # Works!\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"foo\"\n```\n\n**This is the best-practice approach.**\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 2: Only assign dynamically, not statically**\n\nDon't ALSO define `foo` in the `public` list of any class.  \nIf you *must* define them dynamically, then *everywhere* they are used (parent **and** child), define/overwrite them dynamically, and **don't declare them statically**:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo from parent')\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      super$initialize()\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        # Call parent method, if needed:\n        # super$foo() # but this won't work, since foo is not in public\n        print('foo from child')\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"foo from child\"\n```\n\nBut you **lose `super$foo()`** because `super` only works with methods declared in the public list.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 3: Allow dynamic overwriting (`lock_objects = FALSE`)**\n\nYou tried this, but sometimes it still fails due to how super/locking interact. R6 is not designed for both static and dynamic overriding of the same method name. For full flexibility, see Solution 2, **but super won't work**\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaway**\n\n- **Don't mix dynamic and static assignment of methods with the same name across the inheritance tree.**\n- If you want inheritance and `super$` to work, use static definitions in `public`.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Approach              | super$foo() works? | Overriding works? | Notes                                        |\n|-----------------------|:------------------:|:-----------------:|----------------------------------------------|\n| Static methods        | Yes                | Yes               | Best practice.                               |\n| Dynamic methods       | No                 | Yes               | No `super$foo()`; not idiomatic R6.          |\n| Mix dynamic + static  | Error              | Error             | Causes locking error as you saw.             |\n\n---\n\n**Use Solution 1 unless you have a *very* good reason not to.**\n\n---\n\n**Extra**:  \nIf you need to dynamically choose a method, do so with a member variable or a \"dispatch\" function, rather than overwriting the method itself.\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n- [R6 documentation: Inheritance & locking](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html#object-fields-and-methods)\n- [SO: Safe dynamic overriding in R6](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27468911/is-it-possible-to-override-methods-dynamically-using-r6-objects-in-r)\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n> **Define R6 methods as usual in `public`.

When you write `chat = chat`, and you're defining the function inside another function with a parameter also named `chat`, it can lead to *recursive lookups* or *promises* that are already under evaluation (hence the error).\n\nLet's clarify with a minimal example:\n\n```r\nf <- function(x = x) 1\nf()\n## Error: promise already under evaluation: recursive default argument reference or\n## earlier problems?\n```\n\n**What's happening:**  \nWhen you call the *closure* returned by `generate()`, if you don't supply `chat`, R tries to evaluate its default (`chat = chat`), but `chat` is itself (infinite recursion / promise already under evaluation).\n\n---\n\n## How to Fix\n\nReplace the problematic inner default argument.  \nUsually, the pattern you want is:\n\n- Use **no default for the inner `chat`**, but have it closed over correctly (lexical scoping will give you access to the `chat` variable from the `generate` function).\n- If you want an override, use `...`, but default to the enclosing environment's `chat` if not provided.\n\n### Solution 1: Remove the Inner Default\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat) {\n    if (missing(chat)) chat <- chat # This would still be recursive!\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\nBut this is still problematic (`chat` not found in scope).\n\n### Solution 2: Lexical Scoping (Best Practice)\n\nUse the *enclosed* `chat` variable in the inner function, and **don't** supply `chat` as an argument to the inner function unless you really need to override it.\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*If you want the ability to override `chat`:*\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat_override = NULL) {\n    ch <- (chat_override %||% chat)$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n\n# Where %||% is \"or if null\", e.g. from `rlang`:\n`%||%` <- function(x, y) if (!is.null(x)) x else y\n```\nThis pattern is explicit and avoids the recursive promise.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\nThe error is because of `chat=chat` (the *recursive default*).  \n**Fix:** Remove the default from the inner function, or use another name, or use a default like `NULL` and explicitly handle it.\n\n**Best and simplest fix:**  \n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you need to override `chat`, use a different parameter name, e.g. `chat_override = NULL`, and inside the function, use `chat_override %||% chat`.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n- [Hadley Wickham's Advanced R: Promises](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#promises)\n- [Default Argument Evaluation in R](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8461286/using-identical-in-default-argument-of-a-function)",

In your `generate()` function, the signature for the returned function is:\n\n```r\nfunction(input, chat = chat)\n```\n\nHere, the default for `chat` (\"the inner one\") refers to the `chat` variable in the **formals** of the function itself (not your outer function's variable). R tries to lazily evaluate that at call-time, but this results in a recursive self-reference:\n\n- `chat = chat` (the argument's default tries to evaluate itself!)\n\nThat's why you get:\n```\n! promise already under evaluation: recursive default argument reference...\n```\n\n**How to fix:**\n\nYou want the inner function's `chat` argument to *default* to the outer `chat` variable, i.e., the value bound at the time `generate()` is called. The safe way is to use a different argument default like **`chat = NULL`**, and substitute if needed inside the function body:\n\n### Fixed version:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat = NULL) {\n    if (is.null(chat)) chat <- get(\"chat\", envir = parent.env(environment()))\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut that's a bit cumbersome. **More idiomatic R** is: capture the default value by closure, and only allow the inner function to *override* if a value is provided.\n\nSimplest and cleanest is:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat_override = NULL) {\n    ch <- (if (is.null(chat_override)) chat else chat_override)$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow you call it like this:\n\n```r\nf <- generate()\nf(\"Hello\")\nf(\"Hello again\", chat_override = some_other_chat)\n```\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Never use a default argument referring to itself** -- `chat = chat` is never safe in R.\n- Use a different name (`chat_override`), or default as `NULL` and fill in the function body.\n\n---\n\n**Bonus Reading:**  \nSee [Advanced R: Dots and Lazy Evaluation, \"Default values\"](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#default-values) (Hadley Wickham's book), which explains why this pitfall happens.\n\nLet me know if you want an even more streamlined or idiomatic version!\n***\n[Criterion]: It can be fixed by changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the\nfunctions or assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different\nvariable name internally and then supplying that renamed object as the default\nto the inner function.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

In a Shiny app, all reactivity (`reactive`, `renderPlot`, etc.) and access to `input`/`output` **must be inside** the server function.\n\n**Key issues in your code:**\n- You are trying to assign `output$plot` outside the server function.\n- All reactive expressions (`ckd_condition`, `visit_threshold`, etc.) must go inside the server function.\n- When you do `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = function(input, output) { output$plot })`, you're not properly registering your reactivity—you're just referencing an output object that doesn't exist in that scope.\n\n## **How to fix it**\n\n**Correct structure:**\n- Have only non-reactive, static data loading at the top level.\n- All references to `input`, all reactivity (`reactive`, `renderPlot`, etc.), must be inside the server function.\n\nHere's how your app should look:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data (doesn't depend on input, so OK here)\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\n# UI\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Server\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # Reactive filtered data\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition,\n             VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data) > 0, \"No data for selection.

Only place static/global objects outside.\n- Reference `input$...` only inside server.\n- The server returns a **function** with at least arguments `(input, output, session)`.\n- Output objects must be assigned **inside** that function.\n\n---\n\n### **Bonus:**\n\nYou do **not** need to use `reactive()` for things like `input$condition` unless there's complex logic. Access them directly within the server or within your `reactive`/`render*` expressions.\n\nIf you get \"Can't read output 'plot'\", it almost always means you're referencing outputs/reactives in the wrong scope.\n\n**If you still get errors, double check:**  \n- The column names (`CKD_STAGE`, `VISIT_COUNT`, `Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED`) are correct and present.\n- The Excel file loads correctly.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need help with column names or further debugging!"

In a Shiny app, all reactivity (`reactive`, `renderPlot`, etc.) and access to `input`/`output` **must be inside** the server function.\n\n**Key issues in your code:**\n- You are trying to assign `output$plot` outside the server function.\n- All reactive expressions (`ckd_condition`, `visit_threshold`, etc.) must go inside the server function.\n- When you do `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = function(input, output) { output$plot })`, you're not properly registering your reactivity—you're just referencing an output object that doesn't exist in that scope.\n\n## **How to fix it**\n\n**Correct structure:**\n- Have only non-reactive, static data loading at the top level.\n- All references to `input`, all reactivity (`reactive`, `renderPlot`, etc.), must be inside the server function.\n\nHere's how your app should look:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data (doesn't depend on input, so OK here)\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\n# UI\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Server\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # Reactive filtered data\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition,\n             VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data) > 0, \"No data for selection. Adjust filters.\")\n    )\n    \n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run app\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Never** put `reactive()`s or `renderPlot()`s outside the server. Only place static/global objects outside.\n- Reference `input$...` only inside server.\n- The server returns a **function** with at least arguments `(input, output, session)`.\n- Output objects must be assigned **inside** that function.\n\n---\n\n### **Bonus:**\n\nYou do **not** need to use `reactive()` for things like `input$condition` unless there's complex logic. Access them directly within the server or within your `reactive`/`render*` expressions.\n\nIf you get \"Can't read output 'plot'\", it almost always means you're referencing outputs/reactives in the wrong scope.\n\n**If you still get errors, double check:**  \n- The column names (`CKD_STAGE`, `VISIT_COUNT`, `Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED`) are correct and present.\n- The Excel file loads correctly.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need help with column names or further debugging!",

Explains that all server-related outputs must be defined inside the server function\n3. Provides a complete solution showing how to move all reactive expressions and output definitions into the server function\n4. Correctly changes how the server function is structured and how it's passed to shinyApp()\n5. Adds extra helpful explanations about reactives and additional validation\n\nThe solution in the submission correctly moves the `output$plot` and all reactive code into a proper server function, exactly as described in the criterion.

Let's clarify what’s wrong, and how to fix it.\n\n## **What's wrong?**\n\nYour code *defines* server-side `output$plot <- renderPlot({ ... })` in the **global environment**, _before_ you've even defined the `server` function.\n\nThen, in your call to `shinyApp(ui, server = function(input, output) { output$plot })`, the server function merely returns the promise `output$plot` (which does nothing); **it doesn’t actually define any outputs in the correct environment**.\n\nThat's why Shiny can't \"see\" or \"read\" your `'plot'` output.\n\n---\n\n## **How to fix it**\n\n**All server-related outputs and reactives must be defined *inside* the server function.**\n\nAlso, to use `input$...` and `output$...`, these need to be in context of the server function's arguments.\n\n**Here’s how to structure your app properly:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # Create a reactive function to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    # Handle the case where there may be no data\n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data) > 0, \"No data for selected condition and threshold.\")\n    )\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Key takeaways**\n- **Do not define `output$plot` and reactives in the global environment.**\n- **Define all output and reactive expressions *inside* the `server` function**, where you have access to `input` and `output`.\n- Only pass the name of your server function (or an anonymous function) to `shinyApp`.\n\n---\n\n### **Bonus: Fixing your filter**\n\nYou had:\n\n```r\nfilter(CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition, VISIT_COUNT > visit_threshold)\n```\nThat works *if* ckd_condition is a string, but ckd_condition in your original code was a reactive.  \nIf you use it outside render/reactive context, you must add parentheses: `ckd_condition()`.  \nBut just use `input$condition` *inside* the server function; it's simpler.\n\n---\n\n**Summary fix:**  \nMove all your server logic (reactives and outputs) into your server function, and refer to `input$condition` etc. directly. Don't define outputs in the global environment.\n\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you get any other errors!**"

Let's clarify what’s wrong, and how to fix it.\n\n## **What's wrong?**\n\nYour code *defines* server-side `output$plot <- renderPlot({ ... })` in the **global environment**, _before_ you've even defined the `server` function.\n\nThen, in your call to `shinyApp(ui, server = function(input, output) { output$plot })`, the server function merely returns the promise `output$plot` (which does nothing); **it doesn’t actually define any outputs in the correct environment**.\n\nThat's why Shiny can't \"see\" or \"read\" your `'plot'` output.\n\n---\n\n## **How to fix it**\n\n**All server-related outputs and reactives must be defined *inside* the server function.**\n\nAlso, to use `input$...` and `output$...`, these need to be in context of the server function's arguments.\n\n**Here’s how to structure your app properly:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # Create a reactive function to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    # Handle the case where there may be no data\n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data) > 0, \"No data for selected condition and threshold.\")\n    )\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Key takeaways**\n- **Do not define `output$plot` and reactives in the global environment.**\n- **Define all output and reactive expressions *inside* the `server` function**, where you have access to `input` and `output`.\n- Only pass the name of your server function (or an anonymous function) to `shinyApp`.\n\n---\n\n### **Bonus: Fixing your filter**\n\nYou had:\n\n```r\nfilter(CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition, VISIT_COUNT > visit_threshold)\n```\nThat works *if* ckd_condition is a string, but ckd_condition in your original code was a reactive.  \nIf you use it outside render/reactive context, you must add parentheses: `ckd_condition()`.  \nBut just use `input$condition` *inside* the server function; it's simpler.\n\n---\n\n**Summary fix:**  \nMove all your server logic (reactives and outputs) into your server function, and refer to `input$condition` etc. directly. Don't define outputs in the global environment.\n\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you get any other errors!**",

          "explanation": "I'll assess whether the submission meets the criterion by comparing it to the expected solution.\n\nThe criterion states that the issue is with the `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function, and the solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n1. Identifies the core problem that the `output$plot` and reactive expressions are defined outside the server function\n2. Explains that all reactive expressions and outputs must be defined inside the server function\n3. Provides a corrected version of the code that moves all the reactive logic inside the server function\n4. Properly structures the code with a named server function instead of an anonymous function\n5. Correctly explains that the global environment is different from the server environment\n\nThe submission's solution matches the criterion's expected solution in the key aspects - moving the reactive expressions and output$plot into a proper server function. The submission also adds additional explanations and improvements (like adding `req(nrow(data) > 0)` to prevent errors), but these don't detract from meeting the core criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

Identifies the core problem that the `output$plot` and reactive expressions are defined outside the server function\n2.

When you assign `out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token`, if `out` doesn't have an exact `\"refresh_token\"` element but does have `\"refresh_token_expires_in\"`, R *partially matches* `\"refresh_token\"` to `\"refresh_token_expires_in\"`—producing a warning. In the future, this could silently break if strict warnings are enforced or for other APIs.\n\n## How to Fix: Avoid Partial Matching\n\nYou should **always index lists with exact names**, using `[[ ]]` or `is.null(out[[\"refresh_token\"]])`, rather than the `$` operator, which can partial-match.\n\n### Revised Code\n\n```r\ntoken_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {\n  out <- oauth_client_get_token(\n    client,\n    grant_type = \"refresh_token\",\n    refresh_token = refresh_token,\n    scope = scope,\n    !!!token_params\n  )\n  # Avoid partial matching by using [[ ]] and is.null()\n  out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- if (!is.null(out[[\"refresh_token\"]])) out[[\"refresh_token\"]] else refresh_token\n  out\n}\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n- Use `out[[\"refresh_token\"]]` for exact match.\n- Use `is.null()` to check if field is present.\n- Replace `$` with `[[ ]]` throughout where partial matching could be problematic.\n\n### Optionally: Helper Function\n\nIf you use `%||%` often, define it with exact-matching:\n\n```r\n`%||%` <- function(x, y) if (!is.null(x)) x else y\n```\nthen write:\n```r\nout[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token\n```\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n> Change  \n> `out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token`  \n> **to**  \n> `out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token`  \n>  \n> This ensures *no partial matching* and fixes the warning."

You want to replace the first occurrence of `\"||\"` with `\"T\"` and the second with `\"A\"`.  \nHere’s a tidyverse approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\npipe <- tibble::tribble(\n  ~referral_key, ~appointment_key,        ~result,\n  \"OP3349021\", \"4289||10410||1\", \"4289T10410A1\",\n  \"OP3359764\", \"4289||10410||2\", \"4289T10410A2\"\n)\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(\n    result2 = appointment_key %>%\n      # Split into three parts\n      str_split_fixed(pattern = \"\\\\|\\\\|\", n = 3) %>%\n      # Combine with T and A separators\n      {paste0(.[,1], \"T\", .[,2], \"A\", .[,3])}\n  )\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  referral_key appointment_key  result        result2     \n  <chr>        <chr>           <chr>         <chr>       \n1 OP3349021    4289||10410||1  4289T10410A1  4289T10410A1\n2 OP3359764    4289||10410||2  4289T10410A2  4289T10410A2\n```\n\n### **Explanation:**\n- `str_split_fixed(pattern = \"\\\\|\\\\|\", n = 3)` splits the string into three pieces at each double pipe.\n- The parts are recombined with `\"T\"` and `\"A\"` in the desired positions.\n\n---\n\n**If your pattern always has two `||`, this is robust.  \nFor arbitrary cases, you could generalize, e.g., with `str_replace` and `str_replace` again, but splitting and recombining is clean for this pattern.**\n\nLet me know if you need a more general approach!\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the\nsecond:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should\nnot use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as\n`fixed = TRUE`. A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or\n`result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I'll evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion of calling `str_replace()` twice.\n\nThe submitted answer uses a different approach than what's specified in the criterion. Instead of calling `str_replace()` twice in sequence (once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second), the solution:\n\n1. Uses `str_split_fixed()` to split the string at the pipe characters\n2. Then recombines the parts with \"T\" and \"A\" separators using `paste0()`\n\nWhile this approach achieves the correct result, it doesn't follow the required method of using sequential `str_replace()` calls. The criterion explicitly states that `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order, and that the solution should not use alternatives like `str_replace_all()`.\n\nThe submission provides a workable solution but uses a fundamentally different method than what was specified. It doesn't demonstrate the required technique of sequentially replacing patterns in a string.\n\nGRADE: I",

The chain replaces first \"||\" with \"T\", then the next \"||\" with \"A\".\n- If you have **more than two** \"||\", you may want a more general approach, but for this case it works perfectly.\n\n---\n\n## More Flexible (if there could be variable number of \"||\")\n\nIf you want more flexibility, e.g., to replace the first \"||\" with \"T\", the second with \"A\", and ignore the rest, you can use a function:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(\n    result2 = appointment_key %>%\n      str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n      str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\")\n  )\n```\n\nOr, using a custom function (more general):\n\n```r\nreplace_pipes <- function(x) {\n  x %>%\n    # Split on ||\n    str_split(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", simplify=TRUE) %>%\n    as.vector() %>%\n    {paste0(.[1], \"T\", .[2], \"A\", .[3])}\n}\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(result2 = replace_pipes(appointment_key))\n```\n\nBut for your example, **the two str_replace calls are simple and effective.**\n\n---\n\n## In summary:\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(\n    result2 = appointment_key %>% \n                str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n                str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\")\n  )\n```\n**This gives you the output you want.**"

Let’s carefully diagnose and fix your example.\n\n#### **What's Happening?**\n\nYour code:\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x +1, .names = \"x\",))\n```\ncauses this error:\n> `Caused by error in fn(): ! Unused argument (alist())`\n\nThis error typically means that the function in `across()` is being supplied with extra arguments (like a list of parameters) it doesn't expect.\n\n#### **Why?**\n\n- With the way you wrote `.names = \"x\",` (with that extra comma), **across** is getting an extra, blank argument that breaks things.\n- In addition, `.names = \"x\"` will try to create a new column called `\"x\"`, which might not be what you want.\n- The use of `|>` is fine (it's the native pipe).\n\n#### **Solution**\n\n**Fix 1: Remove the extra comma**\n\nThat trailing comma is the main problem!  \nHere’s how you’d write it properly:\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\nOr, *even better*, let’s name the new column something more useful, like `\"vs_plus1\"`:\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\n\n- `{.col}` puts the original column name in the new name.\n\n#### **Full working example**\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmtcars |> \n  mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\")) |>\n  head()\n```\n\n#### **Classic function style alternative**\n\nAlternatively, instead of `\\(x) x + 1`, you can also use `function(x) x + 1` for older R versions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Problem                 | Solution                                         |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Trailing comma          | Remove trailing comma                            |\n| Confusing `.names = \"x\"`    | Name your output properly, or use `{.col}`    |\n| Use of `\\(x) x + 1`     | That's fine, but ensure R >= 4.1                |\n\n#### **TL;DR:**  \n**Remove the trailing comma after `.names = \"x\"` and consider a better name for your new column.**  \nThat will fix the error!",

This is a common issue when working with **dplyr** and other packages that re-export or import functions **not explicitly exported in their own namespace**.\n\n---\n\n### Why does this happen?\n\n- **`dplyr::closest` doesn't work** because `closest()` is **not exported** by `dplyr`.

This is a common issue when working with **dplyr** and other packages that re-export or import functions **not explicitly exported in their own namespace**.\n\n---\n\n### Why does this happen?\n\n- **`dplyr::closest` doesn't work** because `closest()` is **not exported** by `dplyr`. It's likely **imported** from another package (such as **vctrs**) and re-exported for internal use, or attached to the namespace so it's visible when you load dplyr, but **not officially part of the exports**.\n- When you use `closest()` directly **after loading `dplyr`**, it works because it's available in your search path, but you can't refer to it with `dplyr::closest()`.\n\n---\n\n## Solutions\n\n### 1. Find the true source package\n\nCheck where `closest()` is actually exported from.  \nYou can do this in R:\n\n```r\nfind(\"closest\")\n# Or\ngetAnywhere(\"closest\")\n```\n\nThis will probably tell you it's from **vctrs**, or that it's internal.\n\n### 2. Import from the actual package, if public\n\nIf it's a **vctrs** function, use:\n\n```r\nvctrs::closest()\n```\n\nAnd in your DESCRIPTION, add `\"vctrs\"` to `Imports:`.  \nIn your NAMESPACE, either:\n\n- explicitly `importFrom(vctrs, closest)` or\n- use the `::` operator in your code.\n\n### 3. If not exported anywhere (internal function):\n\n#### Option A: Fork & copy (Least Recommmended)\n\n- **Copy** the function's code into your own package (only if it's simple and allowed per license).\n- Document source and attribute.\n\n#### Option B: Reconsider Use\n\n- Sometimes such functions are deliberately not exported because they are **internal API** and might change or disappear.\n- Using them is risky for package stability. Try to find an **alternative** or open a GitHub issue or feature request.\n\n---\n\n## Lint/Build Notes\n\n- Your linter and `R CMD check` warn you because referring to an **unimported, unexported function** is considered bad practice.\n- Either **import from the actual package** or **bundle the code and properly document**.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n- **Don't** use `dplyr::closest` — it's not exported.\n- **Find the real source** (probably `vctrs`). Use `vctrs::closest` and import it.\n- If it's not exported, **avoid using it** if possible.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\n**In DESCRIPTION:**\n```\nImports:\n    vctrs\n```\n**In NAMESPACE:**\n```\nimportFrom(vctrs, closest)\n```\n**In your code:**\n```r\nvctrs::closest(x, y)\n# Or just closest(x, y) if imported\n```\n\n---\n\n**If you need further help finding a suitable alternative, let me know what you are trying to accomplish with `closest()`!**"

If you **need** `closest()`, reimplement or copy safely\n\nIf you want to use `closest` and it's not exported from `dplyr`, you **should not** rely on the internal non-exported object. It's not part of dplyr's public API and can change/break.\n\n**Solution:**  \nCopy/reimplement the functionality inside your package, and prefix it with a package-specific name (to avoid conflicts).\n\n### 2. Fix the linter/build warning\n\nYou should always refer to **exported** functions with `pkg::` notation for clarity and safety—but if it's not exported, you'll get a warning. The solution is to not rely on unexported functions.\n\n### 3. Correct way to use external functions\n\n- Only use `pkg::fun()` for **exported** functions.\n- For non-exported functions, **don't use them; copy if necessary, or request export from package maintainers.**\n\n---\n\n## In summary\n\n- `dplyr::closest()` is not exported, so can't use the namespace notation.\n- If you need similar functionality, **copy/implement it yourself**.\n- Don't depend on dplyr's internal, unexported objects in your package.\n\n### Example for your NAMESPACE/DESCRIPTION (for exported functions only)\n\n```R\n#' @importFrom dplyr filter mutate\n```\n\n**But for `closest`**, implement your own, e.g.:\n\n```R\nmy_closest <- function(x, target) {\n  # Example: returns the value in x closest to target\n  x[which.min(abs(x - target))]\n}\n```\n\n\n---\n\n### Further reading\n\n- [\"Don't use unexported functions from other packages\"](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html#namespace-imports-exports) (`r-pkgs` book)\n- `?getAnywhere`\n- [Tidyverse style guide on namespaces](https://style.tidyverse.org/packages.html#namespace)\n\nLet me know if you need help reimplementing the functionality!\n***\n[Criterion]: The user just needs to add `utils::globalVariables(\"closest\")` somewhere in their package and remove the explicit namespacing; `closest()` isn't exported from dplyr but dplyr will use non-standard evaluation on the expression and handle it correctly.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

                  "text": "Great question! The situation you’re seeing arises because `closest()` is an **internal function** in dplyr. It’s **not exported** from the package namespace, so you **cannot** (and should not) access it as `dplyr::closest()`. That’s why you get:\n\n```\nError: 'closest' is not an exported object from 'namespace:dplyr'\n```\n\n## Why does `closest()` still work in your package?\n\nIf your package **imports all of dplyr** via your NAMESPACE (e.g. `import(dplyr)`), then *internal* functions like `closest()` can be used **within your package**, but only because they're attached in the package environment. **This is not recommended** since internal functions can change without notice.\n\n## Why is this a problem?\n\n- **CRAN & linters warn you**: Using unexported/internal functions from another package is fragile and discouraged.\n- **Potential breakage**: Internal functions can be removed or changed in dplyr at any time.\n\n---\n\n# How to Fix This\n\n**Do NOT use dplyr's internal functions in your package!**\n\n### 1. Copy the Function Into Your Package\n\nIf you really need `closest()` and it's not exported, your only safe option is **copy the source code** of that function into your own package, and perhaps rename it, e.g. `my_closest()`. Make sure you maintain attribution if required (see the license).\n\n```r\nmy_closest <- function(x, table) {\n  table[which.min(abs(table - x))]\n}\n```\n*(This is basically what current dplyr::closest() is as of dplyr 1.1.0)*\n\nThen use `my_closest()`, not `closest()`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Write Your Own Version\n\nIf the function is simple, re-implement it yourself to avoid dependencies altogether (as above).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Ask Maintainers\n\nIf you believe `closest()` is generic enough to be broadly useful, consider [submitting a feature request](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues) to dplyr to have it exported.\n\n---\n\n### 4. If you **must** use an unexported function...  \nYou can use `dplyr:::closest()` (three colons), but this is **NOT** recommended and will give R CMD check warnings/notes. Best to avoid unless you control both packages.\n\n---\n\n# Summary Table\n\n| How to refer  | Is it recommended? | Will your package pass CRAN?  |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| `dplyr::closest()`  | ❌ No  | ❌ No (because it’s not exported)   |\n| `closest()` (*import all*) | ❌ No  | ❌ No (using internal function)  |\n| `dplyr:::closest()` | ❌ No | ❌ No (will get notes/warnings)    |\n| **Copy/re-implement function** | ✔️ Yes | ✔️ Yes (best practice)         |\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n> **Do NOT use unexported/internal functions from other packages in your package. Copy and use the source, or reimplement it.**\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [R Packages: Namespace section](https://r-pkgs.org/namespace.html)\n- [Hadley Wickham on using :::](https://r-pkgs.org/namespace.html#sec-namespace-import-internal)\n- [Why not to use internal functions](https://community.rstudio.com/t/why-packages-should-not-use-non-exported-functions-from-other-packages/30015)\n\n---\n\nIf you need the exact source code for `closest()` from dplyr, let me know!",
