In the "Getting started with vitals" vignette, we introduced evaluation `Task`s with a basic analysis on "An R Eval." Using the built-in solver `generate()`, we passed inputs to models and treated their raw responses as the final result. vitals supports supplying arbitrary functions as solvers, though. In this example, we'll use a custom solver to explore the following question:

> Does equipping models with the ability to peruse package documentation make them better at writing R code?

We'll briefly reintroduce the `are` dataset, define the custom solver, and then see whether Claude does any better on the `are` Task using the custom solver compared to plain `generate()`.

First, loading the required packages:

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: true
library(vitals)
library(ellmer)
library(btw)

library(dplyr)
```

## An R eval dataset

From the `are` docs:

> An R Eval is a dataset of challenging R coding problems. Each `input` is a question about R code which could be solved on first-read only by human experts and, with a chance to read documentation and run some code, by  fluent data scientists. Solutions are in `target` and enable a fluent  data scientist to evaluate whether the solution deserves full, partial, or no credit.

```{r}
#| label: explore-dataset
glimpse(are)
```

At a high level:

- `id`:  A unique identifier for the problem.
- `input`: The question to be answered.
- `target`: The solution, often with a description of notable features of a correct solution.
- `domain`, `task`, and `knowledge` are pieces of metadata describing the kind of R coding challenge.
- `source`: Where the problem came from, as a URL. Many of these coding problems are adapted "from the wild" and include the kinds of context usually available to those answering questions.

In the introductory vignette, we just provided the `input`s as-is to an ellmer chat's `$chat()` method (via the built-in `generate()` solver). In this vignette, we'll compare those results to an approach resulting from first giving the models a chance to read relevant R package documentation.

## Custom solvers

To help us better understand how solvers work, lets look at the implementation of `generate()`. `generate()` is a function factory, meaning that the function itself outputs a function.

```{r}
#| label: generate-output
sonnet_3_7 <- chat_anthropic(model = "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest")
generate(solver_chat = sonnet_3_7$clone())
```

While, in documentation, I've mostly written "`generate()` just calls `$chat()`," there are a couple extra tricks up `generate()`'s sleeves:

1) The chat is first cloned with `$clone()` so that the original chat object isn't modified once vitals calls it.
2) Rather than `$chat()`, `generate()` calls `ellmer::parallel_chat()`. This is why `generate()` takes `inputs`--e.g. the whole `input` column--rather than a single `input`. `parallel_chat()` will send off all of the requests in parallel (not in the usual R sense of multiple R processes, but in the sense of asychronous HTTP requests), greatly reducing the amount of time it takes to run evaluations.

The function that `generate` outputs takes in a list of `inputs` and outputs a list with two elements:

* `result` is the final result from the solver. In this case, `purrr::map_chr(res, function(c) c$last_turn()@text)` just grabs the text from the last assistant run and returns it. `result` is a vector of length equal to `inputs`—it should be able to be tacked onto `task$get_samples()` as another column.
* `solver_chat` is a list of chats that led to the `result`. This may seem redundant with `result`, but is important to supply to vitals so that the package can log what happened during the solving process and display it in the log viewer.

We will work with a slightly modified version of `generate()` that equips models with the ability to peruse R package documentation before answering. We will do so using the btw package, available on GitHub at <https://posit-dev.github.io/btw/>. Among other things, btw provides a function `btw_register_tools()` that registers an ellmer chat with tools to explore documentation.

```{r}
#| include: false
ch <- sonnet_3_7$clone()
```

```{r}
#| label: btw-register
#| eval: false
ch <- sonnet_3_7$clone()
btw_register_tools(ch, tools = "docs")
```

```
✔ Registered tool btw_tool_docs_package_help_topics
✔ Registered tool btw_tool_docs_help_page
✔ Registered tool btw_tool_docs_available_vignettes
✔ Registered tool btw_tool_docs_vignette
```

`btw_register_tools()` modifies the chat object in place, so I can use the chat's `$chat()` method to interact with it like before. As an example, after registering btw with a Claude Sonnet 3.7 chat object, I can ask it about this package. At the time of writing, vitals is not on CRAN, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 completed training several months before I started working on it. Nonetheless, the model is able to tell me about how custom solvers work:

```{r}
#| label: btw-chat
#| eval: false
ch$chat("How do custom solvers work in vitals?")
```

Pretty spot-on. But will this capability help the models better answer questions in R? `are` is built from questions about base R and popular packages like dplyr and shiny, information about which is presumably baked into their weights.

The implementation of our custom solver looks almost exactly like `generate()`s implementation, except we add a call to `btw_register_tools()` before calling `ellmer::parallel_chat()`.

```{r}
#| label: btw-solver
btw_solver <- function(inputs, ..., solver_chat) {
  ch <- solver_chat$clone()
  btw_register_tools(ch, tools = "docs")
  res <- ellmer::parallel_chat(ch, as.list(inputs))
  list(
    result = purrr::map_chr(res, function(c) c$last_turn()@text), 
    solver_chat = res
  )
}
```

This solver is ready to situate in a Task and get solving!

## Running the solver

Situate a custom solver in a dataset in the same way you would with a built-in one:

```{r}
#| label: are-btw
#| eval: !expr should_eval
are_btw <- Task$new(
  dataset = are,
  solver = btw_solver,
  scorer = model_graded_qa(partial_credit = TRUE, scorer_chat = sonnet_3_7$clone()),
  name = "An R Eval"
)

are_btw
```

As in the introductory vignette, we supply the `are` dataset and the built-in scorer `model_graded_qa()`. Then, we use `$eval()` to evaluate our custom solver, evaluate the scorer, and then explore a persistent log of the results in the interactive Inspect log viewer.

```{r}
#| label: are-btw-eval
#| eval: !expr should_eval
are_btw$eval(solver_chat = sonnet_3_7$clone())
```

Any arguments to solving or scoring functions can be passed directly to `$eval()`, allowing for quickly evaluating tasks across several parameterizations. We'll just use Claude Sonnet 3.7 for now.

```{r}
#| label: save-are-btw
#| include: false
if (should_eval) {
  save(are_btw, file = here::here("vignettes/articles/data/solvers/are_btw.rda"))
}
```

```{r}
are_btw_data <- vitals_bind(are_btw)

are_btw_data
```

Claude answered fully correctly in `r sum(are_btw_data$score == "C")` out of `r nrow(are_btw_data)` samples, and partially correctly `r sum(are_btw_data$score == "P")` times. Using the metadata, we can also determine how often the model looked at at least one help-page before supplying an answer:

```{r}
chat_called_a_tool <- function(chat) {
  turns <- chat[[1]]$get_turns()
  any(purrr::map_lgl(turns, turn_called_a_tool))
}

turn_called_a_tool <- function(turn) {
  any(purrr::map_lgl(turn@contents, inherits, "ellmer::ContentToolRequest"))
}

are_btw_data |>
  tidyr::hoist(metadata, "solver_chat") |>
  mutate(called_a_tool = purrr::map_lgl(solver_chat, chat_called_a_tool)) |>
  pull(called_a_tool) |> 
  table()
```

When equipped with the ability to peruse documentation, the model almost always made use of it. To see the kinds of docs it decided to look at, click in a few samples in the log viewer for this eval:

```{r}
#| label: tsk-view
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: "The Inspect log viewer, an interactive app displaying information on the samples evaluated in this eval."
if (identical(Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN"), "true")) {
  htmltools::tags$iframe(
    src = "../example-logs/solvers/index.html",
    width = "100%", 
    height = "600px",
    style = "border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);"
  ) 
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics(here::here("vignettes/data/are_viewer.png"))
}
```

<br>

Did perusing documentation actually help the model write better R code, though? In order to quantify "better," we need to also run this evaluation _without_ the model being able to access documentation.

Using the same code from the introductory vignette:

```{r}
#| label: are-basic
#| eval: !expr should_eval
are_basic <- Task$new(
  dataset = are,
  solver = generate(solver_chat = sonnet_3_7$clone()),
  scorer = model_graded_qa(partial_credit = TRUE, scorer_chat = sonnet_3_7$clone()),
  name = "An R Eval"
)

are_basic$eval()
```

(Note that we also could have used `are_btw$set_solver()` here if we didn't want to recreate the task.)

```{r}
#| label: save-are-basic
#| include: false
if (should_eval) {
  save(are_basic, file = here::here("vignettes/articles/data/solvers/are_basic.rda"))
}
```

```{r}
#| label: are-eval-data
are_eval_data <- 
  # the argument names will become the entries in `task`
  vitals_bind(btw = are_btw, basic = are_basic) |>
  # and, in this case, different tasks correspond to different solvers
  rename(solver = task)

are_eval_data
```

Is this difference in performance just a result of noise, though? We can supply the scores to an ordinal regression model to answer this question.

```{r}
library(ordinal)

are_mod <- clm(score ~ solver, data = are_eval_data)

are_mod
```

```{r}
#| include: false
grade_descriptor <- if (are_mod[["coefficients"]][3] > 0) "higher" else "lower"
```

The coefficient for `solver == "btw"` is `r round(are_mod[["coefficients"]][3], 3)`, indicating that allowing the model to peruse documentation tends to be associated with `r grade_descriptor` grades. If a 95% confidence interval for this coefficient contains zero, we can conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the difference between GPT-4o and Claude's performance on this eval is zero at the 0.05 significance level.

```{r}
confint(are_mod)
```

:::callout-note
If we had evaluated this model across multiple epochs, the question ID could become a "nuisance parameter" in a mixed model, e.g. with the model structure `ordinal::clmm(score ~ model + (1|id), ...)`.
:::

This article demonstrated using a custom solver by modifying the built-in `generate()` to allow models to make tool calls that peruse package documentation. With vitals, tool calling "just works"; calls to any tool registered with ellmer will automatically be incorporated into evaluation logs.

```{r}
#| eval: !expr should_eval
#| include: false
# deploy the resulting logs inside of the page by bundling them into
# `pkgdown/assets/`
dest_dir <- here::here("pkgdown/assets/example-logs/solvers")
vitals_bundle(
  log_dir = here::here("vignettes/articles/data/solvers/logs"), 
  output_dir = dest_dir, 
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```
