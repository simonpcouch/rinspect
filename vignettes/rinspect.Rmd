At their core, LLM evals are composed of three pieces:

1) **Datasets** contain a set of labelled samples. Datasets are just a tibble with columns `input` and `target`, where `input` is a prompt and `target` is either literal value(s) or grading guidance.
2) **Solvers** evaluate the `input` in the dataset and produce a final result (hopefully) approximating `target`. In rinspect, the simplest solver is just an ellmer chat (e.g. `ellmer::chat_claude()`) wrapped in `generate()`, i.e. `generate(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()`), which will call the Chat object's `$chat()` method and return whatever it returns.
3) **Scorers** evaluate the final output of solvers. They may use text
comparisons, model grading, or other custom schemes to determine how well the solver approximated the `target` based on the `input`. 

This vignette will explore these three components using `are`, an example dataset that ships with the package.

First, load the required packages:

```{r setup}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: true
library(rinspect)
library(ellmer)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## An R eval dataset

From the `are` docs:

> An R Eval is a dataset of challenging R coding problems. Each `input` is a question about R code which could be solved on first-read only by human experts and, with a chance to read documentation and run some code, by  fluent data scientists. Solutions are in `target` and enable a fluent  data scientist to evaluate whether the solution deserves full, partial, or no credit.

```{r explore-dataset}
glimpse(are)
```

At a high level:

- `title`:  A unique identifier for the problem.
- `input`: The question to be answered.
- `target`: The solution, often with a description of notable features of a correct solution.
- `domain`, `task`, and `knowledge` are pieces of metadata describing the kind of R coding challenge.
- `source`: Where the problem came from, as a URL. Many of these coding problems are adapted "from the wild" and include the kinds of context usually available to those answering questions.

For the purposes of actually carrying out the initial evaluation, we're specifically interested in the `input` and `target` columns. Let's print out the first entry in full so you can get a taste of a typical problem in this dataset:

```{r input-1}
cat(are$input[1])
```

Here's the suggested solution:

```{r target-1}
cat(are$target[1])
```

## Creating and evaluating a task

LLM evaluation with rinspect happens in two main steps:

1) Use `Task$new()` to situate a dataset, solver, and scorer in a `Task`.

```{r create-task, eval = should_eval}
are_task <- Task$new(
  dataset = are,
  solver = generate(chat = chat_claude()),
  scorer = model_graded_qa(partial_credit = TRUE),
  name = "An R Eval"
)

are_task
```

2) Use `Task$eval()` to evaluate the solver, evaluate the scorer, and then explore a persistent log of the results in the interactive Inspect log viewer.

```{r solve-and-score, eval = should_eval}
are_task$eval()
```

```{r save-are-task-scored}
#| include: false
if (should_eval) {
  save(are_task, file = "vignettes/data/are_task.rda")
}
```

After evaluation, the task contains information from the solving and scoring steps. Here's what the model responded to that first question with:

```{r output-1}
cat(are_task$samples$output[1])
```

The task also contains score information from the scoring step. We've used `model_graded_qa()` as our scorer, which uses another model to evaluate the quality of our solver's solutions against the reference solutions in the `target` column. `model_graded_qa()` is a model-graded scorer provided by the package. This step compares Claude's solutions against the reference solutions in the `target` column, assigning a score to each solution using another model. That score is either `1` or `0`, though since we've set `partial_credit = TRUE`, the model can also choose to allot the response `.5`. rinspect will use the same model that generated the final response as the model to score solutions.

Hold up, thoughâ€”we're using an LLM to generate responses to questions, and then using the LLM to grade those responses?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: "The meme of 3 spiderman pointing at each other."
knitr::include_graphics("https://cdn-useast1.kapwing.com/static/templates/3-spiderman-pointing-meme-template-full-ca8f27e0.webp")
```

This technique is called "model grading" or "LLM-as-a-judge." Done correctly, model grading is an effective and scalable solution to scoring. That said, it's not without its faults. Here's what the grading model thought of the response:

```{r}
cat(are_task$samples$scorer[[1]]$last_turn()@text)
```

## Analyzing the results

Especially the first few times you run an eval, you'll want to inspect (ha!) its results closely. The rinspect package ships with an app, the Inspect log viewer, that allows you to drill down into the solutions and grading decisions from each model for each sample. In the first couple runs, you'll likely find revisions you can make to your grading guidance in `target` that align model responses with your intent.

```{r}
#| label: tsk-view
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: "A screenshot of the Inspect log viewer, an interactive app displaying information on the samples evaluated in this eval."
knitr::include_graphics("data/are_viewer.png")
```

Under the hood, when you call `task$eval()`, results are written to a `.json` file that the Inspect log viewer can read. The Task object automatically launches the viewer when you call `task$eval()` in an interactive session. You can also view results any time with `are_task$view()`. You can explore this eval specifically with the following code (TODO: code to grab from github and view).

For a cursory analysis, though, we can visualize correct vs. partially correct vs. incorrect answers:

```{r plot-1}
#| fig-alt: "A ggplot2 bar plot, showing Claude was correct most of the time."
are_task_data <- 
  # TODO: rename data
  are_task$samples %>% 
  mutate(grade = case_when(
    score == 1 ~ "Correct",
    score == .5 ~ "Partially Correct",
    score == 0 ~ "Incorrect"
    ),
    grade = factor(grade, levels = c("Correct", "Partially Correct", "Incorrect"))
  )

are_task_data %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = grade) +
  geom_bar()
```

Claude answered fully correctly in `r sum(are_task_data$grade == "Correct")` out of `r nrow(are_task_data)` samples, and partially correctly `r sum(are_task_data$grade == "Partially Correct")` times. For me, this leads to all sorts of questions:

* Are there any models that are cheaper than Claude that would do just as well? Or even a local model?
* Are there other models available that would do better out of the box?
* Would Claude do better if I allow it to "reason" briefly before answering?
* Would Claude do better if I gave it tools that'd allow it to peruse documentation and/or run R code before answering? (See [`btw::register_btw_tools()`](https://simonpcouch.github.io/btw/reference/register_btw_tools.html) if you're interested in this.)

These questions can be explored by evaluating Tasks against different solvers and scorers. For example, to compare Claude's performance with OpenAI's GPT-4o, we just need to clone the object and then run `$eval()` with a different solver `chat`:

```{r are-task-openai, eval = should_eval}
are_task_openai <- are_task$clone()
are_task_openai$eval(chat = chat_openai(model = "gpt-4o"))
```

```{r save-are-task-openai}
#| include: false
if (should_eval) {
  save(are_task_openai, file = "vignettes/data/are_task_openai.rda")
}
```

Any arguments to solving or scoring functions can be passed directly to `$eval()`, allowing for quickly evaluating tasks across several parameterizations.

Using this data, we can quickly juxtapose those evaluation results (TODO: this should be a "Adding Error Bars to Evals"-based viz):

```{r}
get_model <- function(c) c$get_model()
are_task_eval <-
  bind_rows(
    mutate(are_task_data, model = purrr::map_chr(scorer, get_model)), 
    mutate(are_task_openai$samples, model = purrr::map_chr(scorer, get_model))
  ) %>%
    mutate(grade = case_when(
      score == 1 ~ "Correct",
      score == .5 ~ "Partially Correct",
      score == 0 ~ "Incorrect"
      ),
      grade = factor(grade, levels = c("Correct", "Partially Correct", "Incorrect"))
    ) 

are_task_eval %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = grade, fill = model, group = model)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```
