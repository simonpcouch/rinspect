Description: A port of 'Inspect', a widely adopted 'Python' framework for
    large language model evaluation. Specifically aimed at 'ellmer' users
    who want to measure the effectiveness of their LLM-based apps, the
    package includes facilities for prompt engineering, tool usage,
    multi-turn dialog, and model graded evaluations.
