          "explanation": "I'll evaluate whether the submitted answer meets the criterion for creating a boolean flag based on the given conditions.\n\nThe submitted answer provides a complete solution using tidyverse that:\n\n1. Groups the data by ID\n2. Creates flags for each condition:\n   - Checks for at least one Type_II\n   - Checks for Type_I instances within 90 days of each other\n3. Combines the conditions with OR logic\n4. Converts to an integer (0/1) flag\n5. Selects only the required columns\n\nThe approach is correct and aligns with the criterion's suggested solutions. The submission uses `group_by()` and `summarize()` to handle the conditions, similar to the first approach in the criterion. It also correctly implements the logic for checking dates within 90 days by using sorted Type_I dates and the `diff()` function.\n\nThe code is well-structured, properly handles edge cases (such as having fewer than 2 Type_I entries), and includes helpful comments explaining each step of the solution.\n\nThe solution correctly implements both required conditions and would produce the expected output as shown in the task description.\n\nGRADE: C",

The challenge is to flag IDs that meet either of these criteria:\n1. At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nHere's a clean solution:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  # Step 1: Group by ID\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  \n  # Step 2: Create flags for each condition\n  summarize(\n    # Condition 1: Has at least one Type_II\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    \n    # Condition 2: Has Type_I instances within 90 days\n    has_close_type_I = {\n      # Filter for Type_I only\n      type_I_dates <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]\n      \n      # If fewer than 2 Type_I entries, can't meet this condition\n      if(length(type_I_dates) < 2) {\n        FALSE\n      } else {\n        # Sort dates\n        type_I_dates <- sort(type_I_dates)\n        \n        # Check if any consecutive dates are within 90 days\n        any(diff(type_I_dates) <= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    \n    # Combine conditions with OR\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II | has_close_type_I)\n  ) %>%\n  \n  # Step 3: Select only ID and Flag columns\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n\n1. First, we group the data by ID to analyze each person separately\n2. For each ID, we check two conditions:\n   - `has_type_II`: Simple check if any row has \"Type_II\"\n   - `has_close_type_I`: More complex check that:\n     - Filters for Type_I dates\n     - Sorts these dates\n     - Uses `diff()` to find if any consecutive dates are within 90 days\n3. We combine both conditions with OR (`|`) to set the final Flag\n4. Finally, we convert to integer (0/1) and select only the required columns\n\nThis solution handles all the edge cases in your example data and follows tidyverse principles for clean, readable code.\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne can also use mutate() to first create\nintermediate variables:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  mutate(\n    flag_i = any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90),\n    flag_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    .by = ID,\n  ) |>\n  summarise(\n    flag = as.numeric(any(flag_i | flag_2)),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

          "explanation": "I'll assess whether the submission meets the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies two key requirements:\n1. The lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin` airport, since a delay at one airport shouldn't affect flights at other airports.\n2. The mean departure delay should be calculated by grouping on the numeric lagged departure delay variable.\n\nExamining the submission:\n\n- The code arranges flights chronologically by `year`, `month`, `day`, and `dep_time`, but it doesn't group by `origin` when calculating the lag. This is a significant issue because it incorrectly assumes that delays at any airport affect the next chronological flight, regardless of location.\n\n- The submission correctly calculates the mean departure delay grouped by the previous delay value and removes NA values appropriately.\n\n- The visualization approach is correct, showing the mean current delay on the y-axis and previous flight's delay on the x-axis.\n\nThe primary flaw is the failure to account for the airport-specific nature of delays. The submission treats all flights as a single sequence rather than recognizing that delays propagate within specific airports.

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged\ndeparture delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Create a visualization\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# First, prepare the data by arranging flights chronologically and calculating lag\nflights_with_lag <- flights %>%\n  # Remove flights with NA in departure time\n  filter(!is.na(dep_time)) %>%\n  # Arrange chronologically\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  # Calculate the lag of departure delay (previous flight's delay)\n  mutate(prev_delay = lag(dep_delay))\n\n# Group by previous delay and calculate mean current delay\ndelay_relationship <- flights_with_lag %>%\n  # Remove rows with NA in previous delay\n  filter(!is.na(prev_delay)) %>%\n  # Group by previous delay\n  group_by(prev_delay) %>%\n  # Calculate mean current delay\n  summarize(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  # Filter out extreme values for better visualization\n  filter(between(prev_delay, -60, 180))\n\n# Visualize the relationship\nggplot(delay_relationship, aes(x = prev_delay, y = mean_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, color = \"steelblue\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs Previous Flight's Delay\",\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    caption = \"Data: nycflights13\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis visualization shows how the mean departure delay of a flight relates to the delay of the immediately preceding flight, helping to visualize the temporal correlation in flight delays.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same\nairport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of\nJFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged\ndeparture delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I'll assess whether the submission meets the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies two key requirements:\n1. The lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin` airport, since a delay at one airport shouldn't affect flights at other airports.\n2. The mean departure delay should be calculated by grouping on the numeric lagged departure delay variable.\n\nExamining the submission:\n\n- The code arranges flights chronologically by `year`, `month`, `day`, and `dep_time`, but it doesn't group by `origin` when calculating the lag. This is a significant issue because it incorrectly assumes that delays at any airport affect the next chronological flight, regardless of location.\n\n- The submission correctly calculates the mean departure delay grouped by the previous delay value and removes NA values appropriately.\n\n- The visualization approach is correct, showing the mean current delay on the y-axis and previous flight's delay on the x-axis.\n\nThe primary flaw is the failure to account for the airport-specific nature of delays. The submission treats all flights as a single sequence rather than recognizing that delays propagate within specific airports. This fundamentally misunderstands the temporal correlation being investigated.\n\nGRADE: P",

This tells ggplot2 what color to use for NA values, but it also affects how unused levels are displayed in the legend.\n\nThe `override.aes` in `guides()` is optional but helps ensure that all legend points have the same shape (16 is the default solid circle).\n\nIf you need to customize the legend further, you can adjust other aesthetic properties in the `override.aes` list, such as size or alpha.",

When you're constructing a URL with parameters containing spaces or special characters, you need to URL-encode those values.\n\nHere's how to fix your code:\n\n```r\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\n# URL encode the address\nencoded_address <- urltools::url_encode(address)\n# Or with httr2\n# encoded_address <- httr2::url_encode(address)\n\nurl <- glue::glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={encoded_address}&api_key={api_key}\")\n\nresponse <- httr2::request(url) %>%   \n  httr2::req_perform()\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use httr2's built-in query parameter handling which will handle the encoding for you:\n\n```r\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\nresponse <- httr2::request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  httr2::req_url_query(q = address, api_key = api_key) %>%\n  httr2::req_perform()\n```\n\nThis second approach is preferable because:\n1. It automatically handles URL encoding of parameters\n2. It's more readable and less error-prone\n3. It separates the base URL from the query parameters\n\nThe `req_url_query()` function will properly encode all parameters, making your request valid.\n***\n[Criterion]: You could format `address` to make at a valid URL by replacing spaces, e.g.\n\n```\naddress <- \"Prince+st+New+York+10012\"\n```\n\nOr by using a function to do so:\n\n```\naddress <- URLencode(\"Prince st., New York 10012\")\n```\n\nHowever, the best solution would be to use a function that handles these \nissues for you, e.g. `httr2::req_url_query()`. This would look something\nlike:\n\n```\nlibrary(httr2)\nbase_url <- \"https://geocode.maps.co/search\"\n\nresponse <- request(base_url) |>\n  req_url_query(q = address, api_key = api_key) |>\n  req_perform()\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

When you use `summarize()` after grouping by multiple variables, dplyr maintains one level of grouping (in this case 'carrier') after the operation.\n\nThe issue with your code is that you're trying to find the single lowest median arrival delay across all carrier-month combinations, but your `filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))` is currently looking for the minimum within each carrier group because the data is still grouped by carrier after summarizing.\n\nTo fix this and get the single lowest median arrival delay across all carrier-month combinations, you need to ungroup the data before applying the filter:\n\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `.groups = \"drop\"` argument explicitly drops all grouping after the summarize operation. Alternatively, you could add an `ungroup()` step before the filter:\n\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\nEither approach will find the carrier-month combination(s) with the absolute lowest median arrival delay in the entire dataset."

When you use `summarize()` after grouping by multiple variables, dplyr maintains one level of grouping (in this case 'carrier') after the operation.\n\nThe issue with your code is that you're trying to find the single lowest median arrival delay across all carrier-month combinations, but your `filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))` is currently looking for the minimum within each carrier group because the data is still grouped by carrier after summarizing.\n\nTo fix this and get the single lowest median arrival delay across all carrier-month combinations, you need to ungroup the data before applying the filter:\n\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `.groups = \"drop\"` argument explicitly drops all grouping after the summarize operation. Alternatively, you could add an `ungroup()` step before the filter:\n\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\nEither approach will find the carrier-month combination(s) with the absolute lowest median arrival delay in the entire dataset.",

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate the submission against the given criterion.\n\nThe submission approaches the problem differently than the criterion suggests:\n\n1. It first groups by tailnum, then summarizes to calculate total_flights, and then filters for tailnums with at least 100 flights. \n   - The criterion says we should filter for tailnums with > 100 flights without prior summarization.\n\n2. The calculation of the proportion of NA values is correct, using `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / total_flights`, which is equivalent to `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` as suggested in the criterion.\n\n3. The final arrangement by descending proportion is correct.\n\nThe main issue is that the submission's approach doesn't match the specified workflow in the criterion. It performs a summarization first to count flights, then filters, rather than using a grouped filter before summarization. While the submission would likely yield the correct answer, it doesn't follow the required method of:\n1. First filtering by tailnums that appear in > 100 flights\n2. Then summarizing to get the proportion of NAs\n3. Finally arranging in descending order\n\nThe approach in the submission is logical but doesn't match the required workflow specified in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P",

The final arrangement by descending proportion is correct.\n\nThe main issue is that the submission's approach doesn't match the specified workflow in the criterion. It performs a summarization first to count flights, then filters, rather than using a grouped filter before summarization. While the submission would likely yield the correct answer, it doesn't follow the required method of:\n1. First filtering by tailnums that appear in > 100 flights\n2.

          "explanation": "I'll assess the submission based on the criterion that the issue is related to using `NS(id)` instead of `session$ns` in the inner module server function.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the core problem: namespace handling in nested modules. It properly explains that within the `moduleServer` function, `session$ns` should be used instead of creating a new namespace function with `NS(id)`. \n\nThe submission includes a complete solution that changes:\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n```\n\nto:\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # Use session$ns instead of NS(id) within the moduleServer function\n```\n\nAnd then uses `session$ns` directly in the UI generation:\n```r\nverbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),  # Using session$ns\nplotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))  # Using session$ns\n```\n\nThis solution correctly addresses the namespace handling issue for dynamically generated UI elements in nested modules. The submission accurately explains that using `session$ns` ensures proper namespace hierarchy maintenance, which matches the criterion.\n\nThe only slight difference from the criterion is that the submission doesn't explicitly assign `ns <- session$ns` but instead uses `session$ns` directly.

The `session$ns` function properly handles the namespacing within the module context.\n\n2. **Added ggplot2 library**: Since your code uses ggplot, I added the library import.\n\n3. **Removed unnecessary variable**: In the `renderUI` function, removed the intermediate `theOutput` variable assignment as it wasn't needed.\n\nThis solution correctly manages the namespaces across your nested module structure, ensuring that the dynamically generated UI elements are properly connected to their respective server-side handlers.\n***\n[Criterion]: The issue is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't\nmaintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules. Using\n`session$ns` instead ensures the dynamically generated UI elements have\nfully-qualified namespaces that properly match their corresponding server\noutputs.\n\n\nSo, change:\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n```\n\nto\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The issue is with the disconnect between the package name (`spatialstuff`) and the GitHub repository name (`org/spatial-Stuff`).\n\n## The Problem\n\nWhen the pkgdown workflow runs, it's not correctly connecting that:\n- The imported package name is `spatialstuff` (in the DESCRIPTION file)\n- This package should be fetched from `org/spatial-Stuff` (in the Remotes field)\n\n## Possible Solutions\n\n1. **Check the actual package name in the source repo**\n   - The package name in the DESCRIPTION file of the `org/spatial-Stuff` repository must match exactly what you're importing (`spatialstuff`)\n   - If the actual package name in that repo is different, you need to match it\n\n2. **Try explicitly specifying the package name in Remotes**:\n   ```\n   Remotes:\n     spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff\n   ```\n\n3. **Consider using the `Additional_repositories` field** in your DESCRIPTION file if the package is hosted in a non-standard repository.\n\n4. **Verify GitHub token permissions** - ensure the workflow has sufficient permissions to access the remote repository if it's private.\n\n5. **Check for case sensitivity issues** - GitHub repository names are case-sensitive in some contexts.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Verify the actual package name in the source repository's DESCRIPTION file\n2. Try the `package=org/repo` syntax in your Remotes field\n3. Check the GitHub Actions logs for more detailed error information\n\nThis seems like a package resolution issue rather than user error, especially if the package works correctly when you install it locally.\n***\n[Criterion]: The user needs to specify the package name explicitly in the Remotes `DESCRIPTION` field using a `<package>=` prefix, e.g. `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff`.\n\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Then R6 tries to add the child's formal `foo` method, but the name is already bound\n\n## Solution Options\n\n### Option 1: Make both use the same approach (formal methods)\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      # No dynamic method creation here\n    },\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()  # This will work now\n```\n\n### Option 2: Make both use the same approach (dynamic methods)\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      super$initialize()\n      original_foo <- self$foo\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        original_foo()\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()  # This will work now\n```\n\n### Option 3: Use a different name in the parent\n\nIf you really need to keep the dynamic method creation pattern, use a different name in the parent:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"parent_foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      self$parent_foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n```\n\n## Recommendation\n\nOption 1 is the cleanest and most maintainable. Using formal methods is the standard R6 pattern and makes inheritance work more predictably.",

Alternatively, you could load it outside both UI and server if the dataset is large and you want to load it only once when the app starts.\n\n5. **Fixed Server Function Call**: Changed from the incomplete `server = function(input, output) { output$plot }` to a proper server function that actually contains the rendering code.\n\nThis structure follows the standard Shiny pattern where UI and server are defined separately, and all server-side logic is contained within the server function."

The main problem is that you're defining `output$plot` outside of the server function, but then only referencing it inside the server function without properly executing the rendering code.\n\n## How to Fix It\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# UI definition\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Server function\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # Load & Rename data \n  Kidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\n  Kidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n    mutate(\n      CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n    )\n  \n  # Create a reactive function to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n    # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n## Key Changes Made:\n\n1. **Proper Server Function**: Moved all the server-side code inside the server function.\n\n2. **Removed Unnecessary Reactives**: Simplified by directly using `input$condition` and `input$visit_threshold` in the `filtered_data()` reactive.\n\n3. **Proper Server Signature**: Added the standard `session` parameter to the server function.\n\n4. **Data Loading**: Moved the data loading inside the server function. Alternatively, you could load it outside both UI and server if the dataset is large and you want to load it only once when the app starts.\n\n5. **Fixed Server Function Call**: Changed from the incomplete `server = function(input, output) { output$plot }` to a proper server function that actually contains the rendering code.\n\nThis structure follows the standard Shiny pattern where UI and server are defined separately, and all server-side logic is contained within the server function.",

The third edition uses actual regular expressions rather than strings that need escaping\n2. It expects a single warning rather than possibly multiple warnings\n3. The regular expression is matched against the full warning message\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```r\nexpect_warning(\n  check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n  \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy\\\\(\\\\)` method for `boop` objects\"\n)\n```\n\nNote that I've:\n- Removed most of the double backslashes since third edition uses true regex\n- Kept the backslashes before the parentheses since they still need to be escaped in regex\n- Removed the escaping of the backticks since they don't need to be escaped in the regex pattern\n\nThis assumes you've already enabled the third edition with `local_edition(3)` or globally with `options(testthat.edition = 3)`.",

So:\n- `\"{.col}_new\"` would create \"vs_new\" \n- `\"new_{.col}\"` would create \"new_vs\"\n- If you just want \"x\", you could use `.names = \"x\"` (without the comma after it)\n\nIf you specifically want the output column to be named \"x\", try:\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(x = across(vs, \\(x) x + 1)[[1]])\n```\n\nOr alternatively:\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1)) |> rename(x = vs)\n```",

That's why `dplyr::closest()` doesn't work - it's not part of dplyr's public API.\n\n## Solutions\n\nYou have several options:\n\n### 1. Use the proper exported function\n\nIf you're using `closest()` for finding nearest matches, consider using `dplyr::near()` instead, which is properly exported:\n\n```r\ndplyr::near(x, y, tol = 1e-6)  # Checks if x and y are nearly equal\n```\n\n### 2. If you must use the internal function\n\nIf you absolutely need this internal function, you can access it with the triple colon operator:\n\n```r\ndplyr:::closest()  # Note the triple colon - this accesses non-exported functions\n```\n\nHowever, this is **strongly discouraged** for package development because:\n- It creates a dependency on dplyr's internal implementation\n- Your package might break if dplyr changes its internals\n- It will cause CRAN check warnings/errors\n\n### 3. Copy the function into your package\n\nThe best approach is to copy the function code into your own package:\n\n```r\n# In your package\nclosest <- function(...) {\n  # Copy the implementation from dplyr's source code\n  # Make sure to properly attribute the source\n}\n```\n\nThen document it and add dplyr to your \"Acknowledgments\" section.\n\n### 4. Switch to an alternative approach\n\nWithout knowing exactly how you're using `closest()`, it's hard to recommend specific alternatives, but functions like `min_rank()`, `row_number()`, or `dense_rank()` (all exported from dplyr) might provide what you need.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nOption 3 (copying the function with attribution) is generally the safest approach for package development, or ideally, find an exported alternative that meets your needs."

If you must use the internal function\n\nIf you absolutely need this internal function, you can access it with the triple colon operator:\n\n```r\ndplyr:::closest()  # Note the triple colon - this accesses non-exported functions\n```\n\nHowever, this is **strongly discouraged** for package development because:\n- It creates a dependency on dplyr's internal implementation\n- Your package might break if dplyr changes its internals\n- It will cause CRAN check warnings/errors\n\n### 3. Copy the function into your package\n\nThe best approach is to copy the function code into your own package:\n\n```r\n# In your package\nclosest <- function(...) {\n  # Copy the implementation from dplyr's source code\n  # Make sure to properly attribute the source\n}\n```\n\nThen document it and add dplyr to your \"Acknowledgments\" section.\n\n### 4. Switch to an alternative approach\n\nWithout knowing exactly how you're using `closest()`, it's hard to recommend specific alternatives, but functions like `min_rank()`, `row_number()`, or `dense_rank()` (all exported from dplyr) might provide what you need.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nOption 3 (copying the function with attribution) is generally the safest approach for package development, or ideally, find an exported alternative that meets your needs.",
