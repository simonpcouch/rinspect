title: recursive-default-argument
input: |-
  I see:


  ```
  Error:
  ! promise already under evaluation: recursive default argument reference or
  earlier problems?
  ```

  When evaluating the function returned by this function:

  ```
  generate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {
    
    function(input, chat = chat) {
      ch <- chat$clone()
      res <- ch$chat(input)
      list(result = res, chat = ch)
    }
  }
  ```

  How can I fix it?
target: |-
  It can be fixed by changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the
  functions or assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different
  variable name internally and then supplying that renamed object as the default
  to the inner function.
