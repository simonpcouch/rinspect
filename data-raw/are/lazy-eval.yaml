title: lazy-eval

  I have some code

  ```
  task_create <- function(
      dataset,
      name = deparse(substitute(dataset)),
      dir = eval_log_dir()
  ) {
    ...
  }
  ```

  I'd like the default name to be the symbol referring to the dataset, e.g. in

  ```
  simple_addition <- tibble(
    input = c("What's 2+2?", "What's 2+3?"),
    target = c("4", "5")
  )

  tsk <- task_create(dataset = simple_addition)
  ```

  ...the name would be "simple_addition". Instead, it's substituted to
  `structure(list(input = c("What's 2+2?", "What's 2+3?"), target = c("4", ,
  "5"), id = 1:2), row.names = c(NA, -2L), class = c("tbl_df", , and "tbl",
  "data.frame"))`. How can I fix that?

  The `name` default is evaluated lazily, and something else results in
  `dataset` being evaluated before `name` is. `name` must be evaluated early in
  the function, e.g. using `force(name)`.
