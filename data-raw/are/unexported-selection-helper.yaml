  I would usually refer to dplyr functions in my package with `dplyr::fun()` however, `closest()` doesn't seem to be exported...

  ```
  dplyr::closest()
  Error: 'closest' is not an exported object from 'namespace:dplyr'
  ```

  Oddly it seems to work as just closest in my package but this is causing lint issues and build notes.

  How do I fix this?
target: The user just needs to add `utils::globalVariables("closest")` somewhere in
  their package and remove the explicit namespacing; `closest()` isn't exported from
  dplyr but dplyr will use non-standard evaluation on the expression and handle it
  correctly.
