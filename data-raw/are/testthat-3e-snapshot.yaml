  Transition this old unit testing code to the third edition of testthat:

  ```
  expect_warning(
    check_ellipses("exponentiate", "tidy", "boop", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),
    "\\`exponentiate\\` argument is not supported in the \\`tidy\\(\\)\\` method for \\`boop\\` objects"
  )
  ```
target: |-
  Instead of the regex, test the warning message with a snapshot:

  ```
  expect_snapshot(
    . <- check_ellipses("exponentiate", "tidy", "boop", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE)
  )
  ```

  Assigning to some intermediate value like `. <- ` it not 100% necessary,
  but it is nice as it prevents the result from being inlined into the snapshot. 
  The call to `check_ellipses()` itself should stay exactly the same.
