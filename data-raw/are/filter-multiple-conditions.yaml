  Here's some data on midwest counties:

  `percbelowpoverty` is percent of people below poverty line.
  `percollege` is percent college educated.

  Write a single tidyverse pipeline to identify the counties that satisfy either of the following condition:

  - more than 40% with college education and less than 20% living below poverty
  - more than 40% living below poverty and less than 10% with college education
target: |-
  This can be achieved with a `filter` with two conditions with the "or" operator, `|`, between them.

  ```
  midwest |>
    filter(
      (percollege > 40 & percbelowpoverty < 20) | (percollege < 10 & percbelowpoverty > 40)
    )
  ```
