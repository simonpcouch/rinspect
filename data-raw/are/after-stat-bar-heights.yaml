title: after-stat-bar-heights
input: |-
  This bar chart shows the count of different cuts of diamonds, and each bar is
  stacked and filled  according to clarity:


  ```

  ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
  ```


  Could you change this code so that the proportion of diamonds with a given cut
  corresponds to the bar height and not the count? Each bar should still be
  filled according to clarity.

  Preferably: 


  ```

  ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
    geom_bar(aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(count) / sum(after_stat(count)), fill = clarity))
  ```


  The dot-dot notation (`..count..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0, but it
  still works:


  ```

  ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
    geom_bar(aes(x = cut, y = ..count.. / sum(..count..), fill = clarity))
  ```


  Simply setting `position = "fill" will result in each bar having a height of 1
  and is not correct.
