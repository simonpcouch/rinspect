  Delays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused
  the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow
  earlier flights to leave. Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code
  to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs
  the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.

  Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same
  airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of
  JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.


  Also, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged
  departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that
  those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the
  submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or
  small bin of minutes).


  Here's an example of working code:


  ```

  lagged_delays <- 
    flights %>%
    arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%
    mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%
    filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))

  lagged_delays %>%
    summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +
    geom_point()
  ```


  At some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,
  NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.


  Using the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.
