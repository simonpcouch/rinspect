title: rlang-paste0-to-cli
input: |-
  Translate the following to the use `cli::cli_abort()`:

  ```
  rlang::abort(paste0(
    "The workflow has arguments to be tuned that are missing some ",
    "parameter objects: ",
    paste0("'", pset$id[!params], "'", collapse = ", ")
  ))
  ```

  Collapse it all into one call to the function, and make sure to pluralize correctly.
target: |-
  ```
  cli::cli_abort(
    "The workflow has {?/an} argument{?s} to be tuned that {?is/are} missing {a/some}
     parameter object{?s}: {.val {pset$id[!params]}}"
  )
  ```

  Notably:

  * There should be a call to `cli::cli_abort()`.
  * There should be no `paste0()`s left in the call. If the string is split up into multiple lines, it can also end with `\` or `\\`.
  * Some attempt should be made to pluralize using the {?} syntax.
