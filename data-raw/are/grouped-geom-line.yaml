  Here's some data on median duration of unemployment, in weeks:

  ```
  unemployment
  # A tibble: 172 × 3
     month  year uempmed
     <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
   1     1  2001     5.8
   2     2  2001     6.1
   3     3  2001     6.6
   4     4  2001     5.9
   5     5  2001     6.3
   6     6  2001     6  
   7     7  2001     6.8
   8     8  2001     6.9
   9     9  2001     7.2
  10    10  2001     7.3
  # ℹ 162 more rows
  # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
  ```

  I want to plot monthly median duration of unemployment with a separate line and color for each year.
  The following gives me a single line.

  ```
  ggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, color = year)) +
    geom_line()
  ```

  How do I fix this?

  You need to use the `group` aesthetic to indicate which observations should be connected together.
  Since you want a separate line for each year, you need to set `group = year` in your aesthetic mappings.

  ```
  ggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, group = year, color = year)) +
    geom_line()
  ```  

  If you want year to be treated as a discrete variable for the legend, you can also transform year to a factor.

  ```
  ggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, group = year, color = as.factor(year))) +
    geom_line()
  ```

  However note that a discrete scale for more than eight levels is usually not recommended.
