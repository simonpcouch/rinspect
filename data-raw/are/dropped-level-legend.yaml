  I'd like to make a ggplot that includes unused levels in the legend:

  ```
  df <- data.frame(x = 1:3,
                   y = 1:3,
                   z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))

  ggplot(data = df) +
    geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +
    scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,
                       values = c(a = "red",
                                  b = "blue",
                                  c = "yellow",
                                  d = "green"))
  ```

  This produces a plot that's correct, where "d" is included in the values in the legend, except that I'd like to see a green dot next to "d" in the legend (instead of the blank spot next to "d") in the same way that other values have corresponding colored dots. How can I do that?

  Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:

  ```
  ggplot(data = df) +
    geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +
    scale_color_manual(
      drop = FALSE,
      values = c(a = "red", b = "blue", c = "yellow", d = "green")
    )
  ```
