title: pak-dependency-name
input: |-
  I have an R package that depends on a package called, lets say, spatialstuff (This is how it is defined in its DESCRIPTIONS). However it is found in an org and the repo name is different, eg org/spatial-Stuff (i have no control over this name!).

  My package in its `DESCRIPTION` file has the following lines

  ```
  Imports:
   spatialstuff
  Remotes:
   org/spatial-Stuff
  ```

  However the `pkgdown.yaml` workflow that is run upon pushes (created from `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`) errors with the following message.

  Can someone explain if this is user error or some other error? Thanks

  ```
  ! error in pak subprocess
  Caused by error:
  ! Could not solve package dependencies:
  deps::.: Can't install dependency spatialstuff
  * spatialstuff: Can't find package called spatialstuff.
  * local::.: Can't install dependency spatialstuff
  * any::sessioninfo: dependency conflict
  * any::pkgdown: dependency conflict
  ```

  The user needs to specify the package name explicitly in the Remotes `DESCRIPTION`
  field using a `<package>=` prefix, e.g. `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff`.
