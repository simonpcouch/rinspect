  I have the following CURL command, but when I try to make the request, it gives me an error. And I don't know how to solve it.

  Curl:

  ```
  curl -X 'GET' \
    'xxxxxx' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "id": 5,
    "fechaInicial": "2023-02-01",
    "fechaFinal": "2023-05-01"
  }'
  ```

  Sintaxis:

  ```
  one2<- httr2::request("xxxxxx") %>%
                  req_headers(`accept` = "application/json",
                              `ApiKey`="xxxxx",
                              `Content-Type`= "application/json",
                             )%>%
                  req_body_json(
                      list(id = 4, fechaInicial="2023-07-01", fechaFinal="2023-09-01" ) )

  cone2 %>% req_perform()
  ```

  This is the error:

  ! HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed

  How do I fix it?
target: |-
  There's a missing `req_method("GET")`.

  Ideally, will also provide an explanation of the problem: httr2 will 
  automatically switch from GET to POST whenever you supply a body.
