  I get an error using `.by` inside `mutate()`

  ```
  Error in `mutate()`:
   In argument: `by = c(id, date)`.
  Caused by error:
  ! `by` must be size 2909492 or 1, not 5818984.
  ```

  How do I fix it?

  From `by = c(id, date)`, we can see that the user actually typed `by` 
  rather than `.by`. They need to use `.by`.
