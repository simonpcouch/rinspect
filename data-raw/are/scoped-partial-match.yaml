  Here's a GitHub issue:

  <issue>
  Google oauth now returns `refresh_token_expires_in` as one of the fields in 
  its response. It looks like this change happened roughly yesterday morning 
  (the warnings first appeared in my log at 5:09am CST, but it hadn't ran 
  since 5:14pm the day before). Because of that, this line in `token_refresh()`
  now results in a warning (which really should be an error):

  ```
  out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token
  # Warning message:
  # In out$refresh_token :
  #  partial match of 'refresh_token' to 'refresh_token_expires_in'
  ```

  Since out has `refresh_token_expires_in` (and not `refresh_token`), adding 
  `refresh_token` doesn't work as expected.
  </issue>

  Avoid partial matching of `refresh_token` in this function:

  ```r
  token_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {
    out <- oauth_client_get_token(
      client,
      grant_type = "refresh_token",
      refresh_token = refresh_token,
      scope = scope,
      !!!token_params
    )
    out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token
    out
  }
  ```
target: |-
  Change `out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token` to 
  `out[["refresh_token"]] <- out[["refresh_token"]] %||% refresh_token`. 
  
  No other changes needed.
