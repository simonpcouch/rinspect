title: geocode-req-perform
input: >-
  I am trying to use a geocoding API. My code is as follows:

  ```
  address <- "Prince st., New York 10012"
  api_key <- "my_secret_api_key"
  url <-
  glue::glue("https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={address}&api_key={api_key}")
  response <- httr2::request(url) %>%   
    httr2::req_perform()
  ```

  However, this does not work. I am getting this error message:

  ```
  <error/httr2_failure>
  Error in `httr2::req_perform()`:
  ! Failed to perform HTTP request.
  Caused by error in `curl::curl_fetch_memory()`:
  ! URL rejected: Malformed input to a URL function
  ---
  Backtrace:
      ▆
   1. ├─httr2::request(url) %>% httr2::req_perform()
   2. └─httr2::req_perform(.)
   3.   └─base::tryCatch(...)
   4.     └─base (local) tryCatchList(expr, classes, parentenv, handlers)
   5.       └─base (local) tryCatchOne(expr, names, parentenv, handlers[[1L]])
   6.         └─value[[3L]](cond)
  ```

  How can I fix this?

  Format the address to result in a valid URL by replacing spaces and, likely,
  removing punctuation. Something like:

  ```
  address <- "Prince+st+New+York+10012"
  ```

  It would also be correct to pass the URL with the existing `address` to
  `URLencode()` or `url_encode()`.
