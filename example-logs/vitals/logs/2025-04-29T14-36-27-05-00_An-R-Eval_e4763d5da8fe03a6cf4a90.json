Stacks the bars as before, but then scales them to have the same height\n2. Makes each bar represent 100% of the diamonds with that cut\n3. Shows the proportion of each clarity category within each cut\n\nThe resulting y-axis will show proportions from 0 to 1 instead of counts, and I've added a y-axis label to clarify this.

          "explanation": "I'll analyze the submitted answer against the criterion.\n\nThe submission provides a tidyverse solution for creating a flag based on two conditions:\n1. Having at least one \"Type_II\" record, OR\n2. Having two or more \"Type_I\" records within 90 days of each other\n\nThe solution correctly:\n- Groups by ID\n- Checks for \"Type_II\" records using `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n- Filters and sorts \"Type_I\" dates\n- Checks for date differences using `diff()` on sorted dates\n- Combines these conditions with a logical OR\n- Returns an integer flag (0 or 1)\n\nThis matches the approach outlined in the criterion. The logic is correct and would produce the expected output. The solution effectively implements both conditions and returns the data in the requested format.\n\nHowever, there's one issue: The submitted solution checks if any pair of consecutive Type_I dates are within 90 days, which is correct, but the implementation is slightly more verbose than needed. The criterion shows a more concise approach using `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` directly in the summarize function.\n\nDespite the more verbose approach, the submission's logic is sound and would produce the correct results.\n\nGRADE: C",

For each ID, we:\n   - Check if any records are \"Type_II\" with `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n   - For the \"Type_I\" within 90 days check:\n     - Filter to just the Type_I dates and sort them\n     - Use `diff()` to calculate the differences between consecutive dates\n     - Check if any difference is 90 days or less\n3. Set the Flag to 1 if either condition is met, 0 otherwise\n4. Select just the ID and Flag columns for the final output\n\nThis approach correctly produces the flags according to your criteria.\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Having at least one \"Type_II\" record, OR\n2. Having two or more \"Type_I\" records within 90 days of each other\n\nThe solution correctly:\n- Groups by ID\n- Checks for \"Type_II\" records using `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n- Filters and sorts \"Type_I\" dates\n- Checks for date differences using `diff()` on sorted dates\n- Combines these conditions with a logical OR\n- Returns an integer flag (0 or 1)\n\nThis matches the approach outlined in the criterion. The logic is correct and would produce the expected output. The solution effectively implements both conditions and returns the data in the requested format.\n\nHowever, there's one issue: The submitted solution checks if any pair of consecutive Type_I dates are within 90 days, which is correct, but the implementation is slightly more verbose than needed. The criterion shows a more concise approach using `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` directly in the summarize function.\n\nDespite the more verbose approach, the submission's logic is sound and would produce the correct results.\n\nGRADE: C"

Here's how to approach this with tidyverse:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  # Group by ID\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    # Check for Type_II\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    \n    # Check for Type_I within 90 days\n    has_close_type_I = {\n      # Filter to just Type_I entries and sort by date\n      type_I_dates <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      \n      # If we have fewer than 2 Type_I entries, return FALSE\n      if(length(type_I_dates) < 2) {\n        FALSE\n      } else {\n        # Check consecutive dates for any pair within 90 days\n        any(diff(type_I_dates) <= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    \n    # Set flag based on either condition being met\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II | has_close_type_I)\n  ) %>%\n  # Keep only ID and Flag columns\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n\n1. We group the data by ID\n2. For each ID, we:\n   - Check if any records are \"Type_II\" with `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n   - For the \"Type_I\" within 90 days check:\n     - Filter to just the Type_I dates and sort them\n     - Use `diff()` to calculate the differences between consecutive dates\n     - Check if any difference is 90 days or less\n3. Set the Flag to 1 if either condition is met, 0 otherwise\n4. Select just the ID and Flag columns for the final output\n\nThis approach correctly produces the flags according to your criteria."

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly handles the temporal correlation of flight delays as specified in the criterion.\n\nKey requirements from the criterion:\n1. Lag should be calculated within each origin airport (grouped by `origin`)\n2. Mean departure delay should be grouped by numeric lagged departure delay\n3. NAs need to be handled properly\n\nAnalysis of the submission:\n- The submission arranges flights by year, month, day, hour, and minute, but crucially does NOT group by `origin` when calculating the lag. It treats the entire dataset as a single time series, which means that delays at one airport are incorrectly influencing the analysis of other airports.\n- It correctly filters out NAs using `filter(!is.na(prev_delay), !is.na(dep_delay))`.\n- It rounds the previous delay to create groups (`prev_delay_rounded`) and calculates mean delay per group, which aligns with the criterion.\n- The visualization approach is appropriate.\n\nHowever, the major issue is that the submission does not consider that the relevant departure delay should be specific to each origin airport. Since flights from different airports operate independently, a delay at one airport shouldn't impact flights at another airport. The submission doesn't use `.by = origin` or equivalent grouping when calculating the lagged values.\n\nThis is a significant conceptual error that would lead to incorrect analysis results and visualization.\n\nGRADE: I",

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: To visualize the relationship between a flight's departure delay and the departure delay of the preceding flight, I'll need to:\n\n1. Sort the flights by time\n2. Use `lag()` to get the previous flight's delay\n3. Calculate mean departure delays\n4. Create a visualization\n\nHere's the code to accomplish this:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Sort flights by time and calculate previous flight's delay\nflights_with_lag <- flights %>%\n  # Arrange by time\n  arrange(year, month, day, hour, minute) %>%\n  # Create a variable for the previous flight's delay\n  mutate(prev_delay = lag(dep_delay))\n\n# Group by previous delay and calculate mean delay\ndelay_relationship <- flights_with_lag %>%\n  # Remove rows where we don't have previous delay data\n  filter(!is.na(prev_delay), !is.na(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Round previous delay to nearest minute to create groups\n  mutate(prev_delay_rounded = round(prev_delay)) %>%\n  # Group by the rounded previous delay\n  group_by(prev_delay_rounded) %>%\n  # Calculate mean current delay for each group\n  summarize(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  # Limit to a reasonable range for better visualization\n  filter(between(prev_delay_rounded, -60, 180))\n\n# Create the visualization\nggplot(delay_relationship, aes(x = prev_delay_rounded, y = mean_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Current and Previous Flight Delays\",\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay (minutes)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis visualization shows how the mean departure delay of the current flight relates to the departure delay of the previous flight. The smooth line helps identify the general trend, which likely shows that delays are indeed temporally correlated - higher previous flight delays tend to correspond with higher current flight delays.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Lag should be calculated within each origin airport (grouped by `origin`)\n2. Mean departure delay should be grouped by numeric lagged departure delay\n3. NAs need to be handled properly\n\nAnalysis of the submission:\n- The submission arranges flights by year, month, day, hour, and minute, but crucially does NOT group by `origin` when calculating the lag. It treats the entire dataset as a single time series, which means that delays at one airport are incorrectly influencing the analysis of other airports.\n- It correctly filters out NAs using `filter(!is.na(prev_delay), !is.na(dep_delay))`.\n- It rounds the previous delay to create groups (`prev_delay_rounded`) and calculates mean delay per group, which aligns with the criterion.\n- The visualization approach is appropriate.\n\nHowever, the major issue is that the submission does not consider that the relevant departure delay should be specific to each origin airport. Since flights from different airports operate independently, a delay at one airport shouldn't impact flights at another airport. The submission doesn't use `.by = origin` or equivalent grouping when calculating the lagged values.\n\nThis is a significant conceptual error that would lead to incorrect analysis results and visualization.\n\nGRADE: I"

When you include `-d` in curl, it implicitly changes the method to POST unless otherwise specified\n\n## Solution Options\n\n### Option 1: Change to POST Method\n\nIf the API expects a POST request with your parameters in the body:\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\nresponse <- one2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use GET with Query Parameters\n\nIf the API expects a GET request with parameters in the URL:\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"GET\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4, \n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", \n    fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\nresponse <- one2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n## Checking API Documentation\n\nSince you're getting a 405 error, I recommend:\n\n1. Check the API documentation to confirm which HTTP method this endpoint expects\n2. Verify if parameters should be sent in the request body or as query parameters\n3. Ensure you have the correct endpoint URL\n\nThe exact solution depends on what the API expects for this particular endpoint.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a missing `req_method(\"GET\")`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

In Option 1, the code explicitly includes `req_method(\"POST\")` as a fix\n2. In Option 2, the code explicitly includes `req_method(\"GET\")` as a fix\n\nThe criterion states there's a missing `req_method(\"GET\")` in the original code. The submission correctly identifies this issue and provides two options to fix it, including explicitly adding the `req_method(\"GET\")` statement in Option 2.\n\nThe submission goes beyond just pointing out the missing method by explaining the broader context of the 405 error and providing multiple solutions based on what the API might be expecting.\n\nGRADE: C"

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: # Adding Colored Points for Unused Levels in ggplot Legend\n\nYou're encountering a common issue with ggplot2 - the legend doesn't show the point symbol for unused factor levels, even when you use `drop = FALSE` to retain those levels in the legend.\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Add an override.aes parameter to guides() function\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(\n    size = 5,  # Optional: make points larger in legend\n    shape = 16  # Standard point shape\n  )))\n```\n\n## How This Works\n\n1. The `guides()` function controls the appearance of legends\n2. By using `override.aes`, we explicitly set the aesthetic properties for all legend items\n3. The `override.aes` parameter forces ggplot to draw the points for all levels, including unused ones\n\nYou can customize further by adjusting the `size` and `shape` parameters to match your plot's styling needs.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

When sending a request with parameters in the URL, you need to URL-encode the address string.\n\n## Solution\n\nHere's how to fix your code:\n\n```r\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\n# Option 1: Use httr2's built-in URL encoding\nurl <- \"https://geocode.maps.co/search\"\nresponse <- httr2::request(url) %>%\n  httr2::req_url_query(\n    q = address,\n    api_key = api_key\n  ) %>%\n  httr2::req_perform()\n\n# Option 2: Manual URL encoding\n# encoded_address <- utils::URLencode(address, reserved = TRUE)\n# url <- glue::glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={encoded_address}&api_key={api_key}\")\n# response <- httr2::request(url) %>%\n#   httr2::req_perform()\n```\n\n## Why This Works\n\n1. **Option 1** uses httr2's built-in parameter handling which automatically encodes parameters properly.\n\n2. **Option 2** (commented out) manually URL-encodes the address before constructing the URL.\n\nEither approach will encode special characters like spaces (to `%20`), commas (to `%2C`), etc., which is necessary for a valid HTTP request.\n\n## Accessing the Response\n\nAfter fixing the error, you can extract the response content with:\n\n```r\n# Parse JSON response\nresult <- httr2::resp_body_json(response)\n\n# If you need to see the content\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis should successfully return the geocoding information for the given address.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for properly handling named breaks in discrete scales.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific changes:\n\n1. In the `init` function, when setting `self$breaks` for discrete scales, `setNames(scale$get_breaks())` should be used to preserve names.\n\n2. In the `break_info` function, when setting `breaks` for discrete scales, use `setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names during mapping.\n\nThe submitted solution doesn't implement either of these specific changes. Instead, it adds a new check in the `init` function to use break names as labels when they exist. While this approach attempts to address the issue of using named breaks as labels, it doesn't implement the required changes to preserve the names through the mapping process as specified in the criterion.\n\nThe submission's approach is conceptually different and doesn't match the specific code changes required by the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

This way, if the primary axis breaks have names, the secondary axis will correctly use those names as labels by default.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

In the `break_info` function, when setting `breaks` for discrete scales, use `setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names during mapping.\n\nThe submitted solution doesn't implement either of these specific changes. Instead, it adds a new check in the `init` function to use break names as labels when they exist. While this approach attempts to address the issue of using named breaks as labels, it doesn't implement the required changes to preserve the names through the mapping process as specified in the criterion.\n\nThe submission's approach is conceptually different and doesn't match the specific code changes required by the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"

          "explanation": "I'll analyze the submission against the criterion.\n\nThe criterion describes a three-step approach:\n1. A grouped filter to keep only tailnums with more than 100 flights\n2. A grouped summarize to calculate the proportion of NA arr_delays using mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n3. Arranging by the result in descending order\n\nThe submission uses a different approach:\n1. It groups by tailnum, then summarizes to get:\n   - total_flights = n()\n   - na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay))\n   - proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n2. Then it filters the summarized data for groups with total_flights >= 100\n3. It arranges by proportion_na in descending order\n4. Finally, it takes the top result and pulls the tailnum\n\nThe key difference is that the criterion expects filtering the raw data first based on group size (keeping only tailnums with >100 flights), then summarizing. But the submission summarizes first, then filters the summary data.\n\nWhile the submission calculates the correct proportion using division instead of mean(is.na()), it applies the operations in a different order than specified in the criterion. The filter should be applied before summarization, not after.\n\nAdditionally, the criterion specifies filtering for n() > 100, while the submission uses >= 100.\n\nGRADE: P",

Groups the flights data by tailnum\n2. Calculates for each tailnum:\n   - The total number of flights\n   - The number of flights with NA arr_delay values\n   - The proportion of flights with NA arr_delay values\n3. Filters to keep only tailnums with at least 100 flights\n4. Sorts in descending order by the proportion of NA values\n5. Takes the first row (highest proportion)\n6. Returns just the tailnum value\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

A grouped filter to keep only tailnums with more than 100 flights\n2. A grouped summarize to calculate the proportion of NA arr_delays using mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n3. Arranging by the result in descending order\n\nThe submission uses a different approach:\n1. It groups by tailnum, then summarizes to get:\n   - total_flights = n()\n   - na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay))\n   - proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n2. Then it filters the summarized data for groups with total_flights >= 100\n3. It arranges by proportion_na in descending order\n4. Finally, it takes the top result and pulls the tailnum\n\nThe key difference is that the criterion expects filtering the raw data first based on group size (keeping only tailnums with >100 flights), then summarizing. But the submission summarizes first, then filters the summary data.\n\nWhile the submission calculates the correct proportion using division instead of mean(is.na()), it applies the operations in a different order than specified in the criterion. The filter should be applied before summarization, not after.\n\nAdditionally, the criterion specifies filtering for n() > 100, while the submission uses >= 100.\n\nGRADE: P"

Uses `match.call()` to get the actual call that invoked the function\n2. Extracts the expression passed to the `dataset` parameter\n3. Checks if it's a simple symbol (like `simple_addition`) and uses that if so\n4. Falls back to the deparsed expression if not a simple symbol\n\nWith this change, when you call `task_create(dataset = simple_addition)`, the name will be \"simple_addition\" as you desire.",

When using GitHub remotes, you need to ensure the package name (in the remote repo's DESCRIPTION file) matches what you're importing.\n\n### Try these fixes:\n\n1. **Verify the actual package name**:\n   - Check the DESCRIPTION file in the `org/spatial-Stuff` repository\n   - Confirm what name is specified in its `Package:` field\n\n2. **Use the correct format in Remotes**:\n   Make sure the Remotes entry is formatted correctly. If the package name differs from the repository name, use:\n   ```\n   Remotes:\n     spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff\n   ```\n\n3. **Update your GitHub workflow**:\n   Ensure your GitHub Action is properly installing remotes. In your `.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml` file, you might need to modify the package installation step to include:\n   ```yaml\n   - name: Install dependencies\n     run: |\n       remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)\n       remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n       install.packages(\"pkgdown\")\n     shell: Rscript {0}\n   ```\n\n4. **Consider using pak explicitly**:\n   Since the error is coming from pak (the package installer used by pkgdown GitHub Actions), you could try:\n   ```yaml\n   - name: Install dependencies\n     run: |\n       pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n       pak::pkg_install(c(\".\", \"pkgdown\"))\n     shell: Rscript {0}\n   ```\n\nThis is a common issue when the package name defined in the remote repository's DESCRIPTION file doesn't match the repository name or the name you're using to import it.",
          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly addresses the criterion of specifying the package name explicitly in the Remotes DESCRIPTION field using a `<package>=` prefix.\n\nLooking at the submission, I can see that the answer does correctly identify the core issue - that the package name needs to be explicitly specified in the Remotes field. In point #2 of the solution section, the submission specifically recommends:\n\n```\nRemotes:\n  spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThis is exactly the format required by the criterion - using the `spatialstuff=` prefix before the repository name.

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission includes the use of `unlockBinding()` to change a locked binding, as specified in the criterion.\n\nLooking at the submission, I noticed that it offers two solutions:\n\n1. The first solution avoids the issue entirely by using static method definitions in both parent and child classes.\n\n2. The second solution uses dynamic method creation in both classes, but doesn't use `unlockBinding()`. Instead, it relies on setting `lock_objects = FALSE` and directly overrides the method in the child's initialize function.\n\nNeither of the proposed solutions utilizes the `unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)` approach mentioned in the criterion. The submission addresses the problem with alternative approaches that may work, but it doesn't meet the specific criterion of using `unlockBinding()` to change a locked binding.\n\nThe correct approach according to the criterion would involve keeping the method definition in the child class and using `unlockBinding()` in the parent's initialize method to allow for dynamic modification of the method.\n\nGRADE: I",

Dynamic method creation in the parent's initialize\n2. Static method definition in the child class\n3. R6's inheritance mechanism\n\nR6 is trying to bind the methods at different times, causing the conflict.\n\n## Solution\n\nYou have two main options:\n\n### Option 1: Make both methods static\n\nDefine `foo` statically in both classes:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()  # Will work properly\n```\n\n### Option 2: Make both methods dynamic\n\nCreate both methods dynamically in initialize:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      super$initialize()\n      # Override the dynamically created method\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        # Access the parent's method\n        parent_foo <- parent_env(self)$self[[\"foo\"]]\n        parent_foo()\n        print(\"and child foo\")\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()  # Should work\n```\n\nThe second approach is more complex because you need to access the parent's environment to call its methods. The first approach is generally cleaner and follows R6 patterns better.\n***\n[Criterion]: To change a locked binding, use `unlockBinding()`, as in:\n\n```\n    initialize = function() {\n      unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the functions, or\n2. Assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different variable name internally and then using that renamed variable as the default in the inner function.\n\nLooking at the submitted answer, the solution does meet the first part of the criterion by changing the name of the `chat` argument in the outer function to `initial_chat`. This avoids the naming conflict between the outer and inner functions.\n\nThe solution also properly implements the functionality, where the inner function can either use a provided chat object or fall back to the one from the outer function.\n\nThe approach directly addresses the issue of recursive default argument reference by renaming the parameter to avoid the conflict, which is exactly what the criterion specifies as one of the acceptable solutions.\n\nGRADE: C"

Fixed the structure of the server function to properly include the output definitions\n5. Corrected the overall application structure to follow standard Shiny conventions\n\nThis reorganization ensures that your outputs are properly defined within the server function context, which should resolve the error.",

Here's how to do it:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npipe <- tibble::tribble(\n  ~referral_key, ~appointment_key, ~result,\n  \"OP3349021\", \"4289||10410||1\", \"4289T10410A1\",\n  \"OP3359764\", \"4289||10410||2\", \"4289T10410A2\"\n)\n\n# Solution with stringr\npipe %>%\n  mutate(transformed = str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>% \n                       str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to create a new column that matches your result column:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(transformed = str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>% \n                       str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\nIf you want to update the existing `appointment_key` column instead:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(appointment_key = str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>% \n                          str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\nThe key here is using `str_replace()` twice in sequence - the first call replaces the first occurrence with \"T\", and the second call replaces the remaining occurrence with \"A\".",
