You need to flag IDs that meet either of these conditions:\n   - At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n   - Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLet's explore how to solve this with dplyr and related tidyverse packages:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# First, let's create a function to check if there are any Type_I observations within 90 days of each other\ncheck_type_i_within_90_days <- function(dates) {\n  if(length(dates) < 2) return(FALSE)\n  \n  # Sort the dates\n  sorted_dates <- sort(dates)\n  \n  # Check consecutive pairs of dates for any that are within 90 days\n  for(i in 1:(length(sorted_dates) - 1)) {\n    if(as.numeric(sorted_dates[i+1] - sorted_dates[i]) <= 90) {\n      return(TRUE)\n    }\n  }\n  return(FALSE)\n}\n\n# Now apply the criteria to create the flag\nresult <- df %>%\n  # Group by ID to analyze each ID separately\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  # Check both conditions\n  summarize(\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    type_I_dates = list(date[type == \"Type_I\"]),\n    type_I_within_90_days = map_lgl(type_I_dates, check_type_i_within_90_days),\n    # Set the flag if either condition is met\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II | type_I_within_90_days)\n  ) %>%\n  # Keep only ID and Flag columns\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\nThis code:\n1. Groups the data by ID\n2. For each ID, checks if there is at least one \"Type_II\" entry\n3. For each ID, extracts the dates of \"Type_I\" entries and checks if any are within 90 days of each other using a custom function\n4. Creates a flag (0 or 1) based on whether either condition is met\n5. Selects only the ID and Flag columns for the final output\n\nIf you'd prefer a solution without a custom function, here's an alternative approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  # Group by ID to analyze each ID separately\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    # Check for Type_II\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    \n    # Check for Type_I within 90 days\n    type_I_within_90_days = {\n      # Get only Type_I dates\n      type_i_dates <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]\n      \n      if(length(type_i_dates) < 2) {\n        FALSE\n      } else {\n        # Create all pairwise date differences\n        date_pairs <- combn(type_i_dates, 2, simplify = TRUE)\n        # Check if any pairs have a difference of 90 days or less\n        any(abs(as.numeric(date_pairs[1,] - date_pairs[2,])) <= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    \n    # Set the flag if either condition is met\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II | type_I_within_90_days)\n  ) %>%\n  # Keep only ID and Flag columns\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\nBoth approaches should give you the desired output showing which IDs meet at least one of your specified criteria.",
          "explanation": "I'll evaluate the submission against the criterion.\n\nThe submission provides two approaches using tidyverse to set a conditional flag based on the given criteria:\n1. A solution using a custom function `check_type_i_within_90_days`\n2. An alternative approach using `combn()` to check pairwise date differences\n\nLet's analyze whether these correctly implement the required criteria:\n\n1. **First criterion**: Flag IDs with at least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n   - Both solutions correctly implement this with `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n\n2. **Second criterion**: Flag IDs with two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n   - The first solution sorts dates and checks consecutive pairs which is a logical approach\n   - The second solution uses `combn()` to check all possible pairs\n\nThe main issue is with the implementation of the second criterion. The criterion expects to flag cases where two Type_I records are within 90 days of each other. However:\n\n- The first solution only checks consecutive dates after sorting, which might miss some pairs within 90 days if there are intervening dates\n- The second solution with `combn()` is closer, but it checks if the absolute difference between any pair is <= 90, which is correct\n\nThe criterion solution is simpler and more direct, using `diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90` to check consecutive sorted dates, which would only find adjacent dates within 90 days, potentially missing some valid pairs.\n\nWhile the submitted solutions attempt the right approach and would work for many cases, they don't perfectly match the criterion solution. However, the combn() approach in the second solution would correctly identify all pairs within 90 days, which is what the task requires.\n\nGRADE: P",

You need to flag IDs that meet either of these conditions:\n   - At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n   - Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLet's explore how to solve this with dplyr and related tidyverse packages:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# First, let's create a function to check if there are any Type_I observations within 90 days of each other\ncheck_type_i_within_90_days <- function(dates) {\n  if(length(dates) < 2) return(FALSE)\n  \n  # Sort the dates\n  sorted_dates <- sort(dates)\n  \n  # Check consecutive pairs of dates for any that are within 90 days\n  for(i in 1:(length(sorted_dates) - 1)) {\n    if(as.numeric(sorted_dates[i+1] - sorted_dates[i]) <= 90) {\n      return(TRUE)\n    }\n  }\n  return(FALSE)\n}\n\n# Now apply the criteria to create the flag\nresult <- df %>%\n  # Group by ID to analyze each ID separately\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  # Check both conditions\n  summarize(\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    type_I_dates = list(date[type == \"Type_I\"]),\n    type_I_within_90_days = map_lgl(type_I_dates, check_type_i_within_90_days),\n    # Set the flag if either condition is met\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II | type_I_within_90_days)\n  ) %>%\n  # Keep only ID and Flag columns\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\nThis code:\n1. Groups the data by ID\n2. For each ID, checks if there is at least one \"Type_II\" entry\n3. For each ID, extracts the dates of \"Type_I\" entries and checks if any are within 90 days of each other using a custom function\n4. Creates a flag (0 or 1) based on whether either condition is met\n5. Selects only the ID and Flag columns for the final output\n\nIf you'd prefer a solution without a custom function, here's an alternative approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  # Group by ID to analyze each ID separately\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    # Check for Type_II\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    \n    # Check for Type_I within 90 days\n    type_I_within_90_days = {\n      # Get only Type_I dates\n      type_i_dates <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]\n      \n      if(length(type_i_dates) < 2) {\n        FALSE\n      } else {\n        # Create all pairwise date differences\n        date_pairs <- combn(type_i_dates, 2, simplify = TRUE)\n        # Check if any pairs have a difference of 90 days or less\n        any(abs(as.numeric(date_pairs[1,] - date_pairs[2,])) <= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    \n    # Set the flag if either condition is met\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II | type_I_within_90_days)\n  ) %>%\n  # Keep only ID and Flag columns\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\nBoth approaches should give you the desired output showing which IDs meet at least one of your specified criteria."

You need to flag IDs that meet either of these conditions:\n   - At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n   - Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLet's explore how to solve this with dplyr and related tidyverse packages:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# First, let's create a function to check if there are any Type_I observations within 90 days of each other\ncheck_type_i_within_90_days <- function(dates) {\n  if(length(dates) < 2) return(FALSE)\n  \n  # Sort the dates\n  sorted_dates <- sort(dates)\n  \n  # Check consecutive pairs of dates for any that are within 90 days\n  for(i in 1:(length(sorted_dates) - 1)) {\n    if(as.numeric(sorted_dates[i+1] - sorted_dates[i]) <= 90) {\n      return(TRUE)\n    }\n  }\n  return(FALSE)\n}\n\n# Now apply the criteria to create the flag\nresult <- df %>%\n  # Group by ID to analyze each ID separately\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  # Check both conditions\n  summarize(\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    type_I_dates = list(date[type == \"Type_I\"]),\n    type_I_within_90_days = map_lgl(type_I_dates, check_type_i_within_90_days),\n    # Set the flag if either condition is met\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II | type_I_within_90_days)\n  ) %>%\n  # Keep only ID and Flag columns\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\nThis code:\n1. Groups the data by ID\n2. For each ID, checks if there is at least one \"Type_II\" entry\n3. For each ID, extracts the dates of \"Type_I\" entries and checks if any are within 90 days of each other using a custom function\n4. Creates a flag (0 or 1) based on whether either condition is met\n5. Selects only the ID and Flag columns for the final output\n\nIf you'd prefer a solution without a custom function, here's an alternative approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  # Group by ID to analyze each ID separately\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    # Check for Type_II\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    \n    # Check for Type_I within 90 days\n    type_I_within_90_days = {\n      # Get only Type_I dates\n      type_i_dates <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]\n      \n      if(length(type_i_dates) < 2) {\n        FALSE\n      } else {\n        # Create all pairwise date differences\n        date_pairs <- combn(type_i_dates, 2, simplify = TRUE)\n        # Check if any pairs have a difference of 90 days or less\n        any(abs(as.numeric(date_pairs[1,] - date_pairs[2,])) <= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    \n    # Set the flag if either condition is met\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II | type_I_within_90_days)\n  ) %>%\n  # Keep only ID and Flag columns\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\nBoth approaches should give you the desired output showing which IDs meet at least one of your specified criteria.",

However:\n\n- The first solution only checks consecutive dates after sorting, which might miss some pairs within 90 days if there are intervening dates\n- The second solution with `combn()` is closer, but it checks if the absolute difference between any pair is <= 90, which is correct\n\nThe criterion solution is simpler and more direct, using `diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90` to check consecutive sorted dates, which would only find adjacent dates within 90 days, potentially missing some valid pairs.\n\nWhile the submitted solutions attempt the right approach and would work for many cases, they don't perfectly match the criterion solution. However, the combn() approach in the second solution would correctly identify all pairs within 90 days, which is what the task requires.\n\nGRADE: P",

This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

Let me look into how to achieve this with ggplot2.\n\nI'll check the help documentation for functions related to legends and scales in ggplot2 to find the best solution.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission doesn't identify either of these specific changes. Instead, it only offers a general analysis stating that it will \"analyze the code\" and \"propose edits to handle named discrete breaks properly\", but doesn't actually provide any concrete code changes.\n\nThe submission doesn't identify the locations in the code that need to be modified, nor does it provide the specific code changes required by the criterion.

All secondary\n#' axes must be based on a one-to-one transformation of the primary axes.\n#'\n#' @param transform A formula or function of a strictly monotonic transformation\n#'\n#' @param trans `r lifecycle::badge(\"deprecated\")`\n#'\n#' @param name The name of the secondary axis\n#'\n#' @param breaks One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no breaks\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default breaks computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A numeric vector of positions\n#'   - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output\n#'\n#' @param labels One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no labels\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default labels computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)\n#'   - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as output\n#'\n#' @param guide A position guide that will be used to render\n#'   the axis on the plot.

The key differences are:\n\n1. **Filtering approach**: \n   - Criterion wants: Filter groups with `n() > 100` (filtering whole groups)\n   - Submission uses: `filter(total_flights >= 100)` (filtering after summarization)\n\n2. **Calculation of NA proportion**:\n   - Criterion wants: `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` \n   - Submission uses: `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / total_flights` (which is mathematically equivalent but not the exact approach specified)\n\n3. **Order of operations**:\n   - Criterion wants: Filter first to keep groups with >100 flights, then summarize\n   - Submission: Summarizes first (getting total flights and NA counts), then filters\n\nThe submission will get the correct answer, but it doesn't follow the specified three-step approach in the criterion. The criterion specifically states that \"no persistent summarization across rows should happen\" in the filtering step, but the submission does summarization first.\n\nThe submission also includes extra code to select only the tailnum column at the end, which isn't required by the criterion but doesn't hurt.\n\nGRADE: P",

Count the total number of flights for each tailnum\n2. Count the number of NA values in arr_delay for each tailnum\n3. Calculate the proportion of NA values\n4. Filter for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n5. Find the tailnum with the highest proportion of NAs\n\nHere's the code to accomplish this:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  # Group by tailnum\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  # Summarize to get counts and proportions\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  # Filter for planes with at least 100 flights\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  # Sort in descending order of the proportion of NAs\n  arrange(desc(proportion_na)) %>%\n  # Take the top result\n  slice(1) %>%\n  # Select just the tailnum if you only want that column\n  select(tailnum)\n```\n\nThis code will:\n1. Group the flights by tailnum\n2. For each tailnum, count the total number of flights and the number of NA values in arr_delay\n3. Calculate the proportion of NAs\n4. Filter to include only tailnums with 100+ flights\n5. Sort to find the tailnum with the highest proportion of NAs\n6. Return only the top result\n\nThe output will be the tailnum of the aircraft with the highest proportion of NA arr_delay values among those that have flown at least 100 flights."

Count the total number of flights for each tailnum\n2. Count the number of NA values in arr_delay for each tailnum\n3. Calculate the proportion of NA values\n4. Filter for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n5. Find the tailnum with the highest proportion of NAs\n\nHere's the code to accomplish this:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  # Group by tailnum\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  # Summarize to get counts and proportions\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  # Filter for planes with at least 100 flights\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  # Sort in descending order of the proportion of NAs\n  arrange(desc(proportion_na)) %>%\n  # Take the top result\n  slice(1) %>%\n  # Select just the tailnum if you only want that column\n  select(tailnum)\n```\n\nThis code will:\n1. Group the flights by tailnum\n2. For each tailnum, count the total number of flights and the number of NA values in arr_delay\n3. Calculate the proportion of NAs\n4. Filter to include only tailnums with 100+ flights\n5. Sort to find the tailnum with the highest proportion of NAs\n6. Return only the top result\n\nThe output will be the tailnum of the aircraft with the highest proportion of NA arr_delay values among those that have flown at least 100 flights.",
