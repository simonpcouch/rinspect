          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submitted solution correctly implements the required flagging logic using tidyverse.\n\nThe criterion provides two valid approaches:\n1. Using `group_by()` and `summarize()` with the `any()` function to check for Type_II and using `diff(sort())` to check for Type_I records within 90 days\n2. Using a sequential approach with `mutate()` to flag individual records and then `summarize()` to aggregate by ID\n\nThe submitted solution attempts to solve the problem using tidyverse, but has some issues:\n\n1. The approach is overly complex, using nested functions like `map_lgl()` where simpler solutions exist\n2. The logic for checking Type_I records within 90 days is not implemented efficiently - it's checking all pairwise distances rather than just sorting and using `diff()`\n3. The code would be computationally intensive for larger datasets\n4. The approach of using `if_else()` with `map_lgl()` inside a `mutate()` is mixing functional programming paradigms in a way that's not idiomatic tidyverse style\n\nWhile the solution might produce correct results, it doesn't follow the efficient and idiomatic approach shown in the criterion. The solution is functional but inefficient and unnecessarily complex compared to the simpler approaches provided in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P",

Two or more \"Type_I\" records within 90 days of each other\n\nHere's how to do it with tidyverse:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  # First check for Type_II condition\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\")) %>%\n  \n  # Then check for Type_I within 90 days condition\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(\n    has_close_type_I = if_else(\n      type == \"Type_I\",\n      # For each Type_I record, check if any other Type_I records are within 90 days\n      map_lgl(date, function(d) {\n        type_I_dates <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]\n        # Count how many other Type_I dates are within 90 days\n        sum(abs(as.numeric(difftime(d, type_I_dates, units = \"days\"))) <= 90 & \n            abs(as.numeric(difftime(d, type_I_dates, units = \"days\"))) > 0) > 0\n      }),\n      FALSE\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  \n  # Create final flag and summarize by ID\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II[1] | any(has_close_type_I))\n  )\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n\n1. **Type_II check**: We create a `has_type_II` flag that's TRUE if any record for that ID is \"Type_II\"\n\n2. **Type_I proximity check**: For each \"Type_I\" record, we check if there are any other \"Type_I\" records within 90 days by:\n   - Using `map_lgl()` to iterate through each date\n   - Computing the difference between the current date and all other \"Type_I\" dates\n   - Checking if any differences are ≤ 90 days (but not the same date)\n\n3. **Final flag**: We combine both conditions with an OR operation, converting to integer (0/1)\n\nThis solution will handle all your cases correctly, including IDs with multiple records and different combinations of types.\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Using `group_by()` and `summarize()` with the `any()` function to check for Type_II and using `diff(sort())` to check for Type_I records within 90 days\n2. Using a sequential approach with `mutate()` to flag individual records and then `summarize()` to aggregate by ID\n\nThe submitted solution attempts to solve the problem using tidyverse, but has some issues:\n\n1. The approach is overly complex, using nested functions like `map_lgl()` where simpler solutions exist\n2. The logic for checking Type_I records within 90 days is not implemented efficiently - it's checking all pairwise distances rather than just sorting and using `diff()`\n3. The code would be computationally intensive for larger datasets\n4. The approach of using `if_else()` with `map_lgl()` inside a `mutate()` is mixing functional programming paradigms in a way that's not idiomatic tidyverse style\n\nWhile the solution might produce correct results, it doesn't follow the efficient and idiomatic approach shown in the criterion. The solution is functional but inefficient and unnecessarily complex compared to the simpler approaches provided in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P"

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: I'll help you visualize the mean departure delay against the departure delay of the preceding flight using dplyr's `lag()` function.\n\nFirst, we need to:\n1. Arrange the flights chronologically\n2. Create a lagged departure delay column\n3. Group by the lagged delay\n4. Calculate the mean departure delay for each group\n5. Visualize the relationship\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Assuming flights dataset is already loaded\n\nflights_with_lag <- flights %>%\n  # Sort flights chronologically\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  # Create lagged departure delay column\n  mutate(previous_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Remove NA values (first flight won't have a previous flight)\n  filter(!is.na(previous_dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay))\n\n# Calculate mean delay grouped by previous delay\ndelay_relationship <- flights_with_lag %>%\n  # Round previous delay to nearest integer to create groups\n  mutate(previous_delay_rounded = round(previous_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Group by previous delay\n  group_by(previous_delay_rounded) %>%\n  # Calculate mean delay for each group\n  summarise(\n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n()\n  ) %>%\n  # Filter out extreme values with few observations for better visualization\n  filter(n > 10, \n         previous_delay_rounded > -60, \n         previous_delay_rounded < 120)\n\n# Create visualization\nggplot(delay_relationship, aes(x = previous_delay_rounded, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = n), alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Current Flight Delay and Previous Flight Delay\",\n    x = \"Previous Flight Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    size = \"Number of Flights\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis visualization will show how the mean departure delay of flights relates to the departure delay of the previous flight. The point size represents the number of flights in each group, which helps in understanding the distribution of the data.\n\nThe smooth line helps visualize the trend: if delays are temporally correlated, we'd expect to see a positive relationship between previous and current flight delays.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

You're using:\n\n- A GET request (`-X 'GET'` in curl)\n- But also sending a request body with the `-d` parameter\n\n**This is the conflict**: While technically possible to send a body with a GET request, many servers don't process body content for GET requests as it's not standard practice according to HTTP specifications.\n\n## Solution\n\nYou have two options:\n\n### Option 1: Change to POST request (recommended if the API supports it)\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%  # Change from GET to POST\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey`=\"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type`= \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial=\"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal=\"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n### Option 2: Move parameters to query string (for GET requests)\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey`=\"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4, \n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", \n    fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n## Check API Documentation\n\nIf possible, I recommend checking the API documentation to understand which HTTP methods are supported for the endpoint you're calling. The 405 error suggests the method you're using isn't what the server expects.",

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: # Fixing the Legend in ggplot with Unused Levels\n\nTo display a colored dot next to the unused level \"d\" in your legend, you need to adjust how ggplot handles the guides. The issue occurs because ggplot doesn't show the color key for unused factor levels by default, even when you set `drop = FALSE`.\n\nHere's a solution:\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(\n    shape = c(16, 16, 16, 16),  # Shape for all points (including unused)\n    color = c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"yellow\", \"green\")  # Explicit colors for all levels\n  )))\n```\n\n## How This Works\n\nThe key addition is the `guides()` function with `override.aes`:\n\n1. `guide_legend()` allows you to customize the legend appearance\n2. `override.aes` specifically overrides the visual properties displayed in the legend\n3. By explicitly setting the `shape` and `color` for all factor levels (including unused \"d\"), you force the legend to display all points\n\nYou can further customize this by adjusting point sizes or other aesthetic properties if needed.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate if the submission adequately implements the changes needed according to the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific code changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nLooking at the submission, the candidate has taken a completely different approach. Instead of making these specific syntax changes to preserve names when getting or mapping breaks, they've added a new conditional block that checks for named breaks and manually assigns those names to the labels.\n\nWhile the submission attempts to address the goal of using break names as labels, it does not implement the specific changes required by the criterion. The solution proposed by the criterion is more direct and addresses the root cause by ensuring that break names are preserved during the mapping process.\n\nThe candidate's solution might work in some cases, but it doesn't follow the specific implementation instructions given in the criterion. The required changes were very specific and minimal, but the submission uses a different approach entirely.\n\nGRADE: I",

If both conditions are true, sets the labels to the names of the breaks\n\nThis will ensure that when discrete breaks have names, those names will be used as labels by default for the secondary axis, consistent with how primary axes handle named breaks.",

          "explanation": "Let me evaluate the submitted answer against the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies that the solution should have three main steps:\n1. A grouped filter to keep only tailnums with > 100 flights\n2. A grouped summarize to calculate the proportion of NA arr_delay using mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n3. An arrange to sort in descending order\n\nThe submitted solution:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(proportion_na)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThis solution takes a different approach than specified in the criterion:\n- Instead of filtering grouped data first, it calculates summaries for all tailnums and then filters\n- It uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay))/total_flights` instead of `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion\n- It adds additional steps (slice and pull) that weren't required\n\nWhile the solution will technically produce the correct answer (the calculation approach is mathematically equivalent), it doesn't follow the specified workflow in the criterion. The criterion specifically mentioned using a grouped filter followed by a summarize, rather than summarizing first and then filtering.\n\nGRADE: P",

Groups the flights data by tailnum\n2. For each tailnum, calculates:\n   - Total number of flights\n   - Number of flights with NA arr_delay values\n   - Proportion of flights with NA arr_delay values\n3. Filters to include only tailnums with at least 100 flights\n4. Sorts by the proportion of NA values in descending order\n5. Takes the top result (highest proportion)\n6. Returns just the tailnum value\n\nThis will give us the tailnum with the highest proportion of missing arrival delay information among planes that have flown at least 100 times.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The criterion specifically mentioned using a grouped filter followed by a summarize, rather than summarizing first and then filtering.\n\nGRADE: P"

This approach uses `substitute(dataset)` to capture the expression passed as `dataset` without evaluating it\n2. `is.name()` checks if the expression is a simple symbol/name\n3. If it's a simple name, we convert it to a character string\n4. If not (e.g., if it's a complex expression), we fall back to the original behavior but take just the first element to avoid long deparsed strings\n\nThis will properly capture \"simple_addition\" when you call `task_create(simple_addition)` but still handle other cases gracefully.",

Your package imports `spatialstuff` (the actual R package name)\n2. This package is hosted at GitHub repo `org/spatial-Stuff` (note the different naming format)\n3. The pkgdown GitHub Action is using `pak` to install dependencies, which can't find `spatialstuff`\n\n## Solution\n\nThe problem is in how your `Remotes:` field is specified. When the package name differs from the GitHub repository name, you need to use a special syntax in the `Remotes:` field:\n\n```\nRemotes:\n  org/spatial-Stuff@*release\n```\n\nshould be changed to:\n\n```\nRemotes:\n  spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThis explicitly tells R package managers (including pak) that the package named `spatialstuff` can be found at the GitHub repository `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n1. The `@*release` part in your original is unnecessary unless you specifically need a particular branch/tag.\n\n2. This is a common issue when GitHub repo names don't perfectly match R package names (due to case differences, hyphens vs. dots, etc.).\n\n3. If this solution doesn't work, you might need to check if the package in the GitHub repository actually has the correct package name in its own DESCRIPTION file.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this solution in more detail?\n***\n[Criterion]: The user needs to specify the package name explicitly in the Remotes `DESCRIPTION` field using a `<package>=` prefix, e.g. `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

But the binding for `foo` is already locked by this point\n\n## Solution\n\nYou have two main options:\n\n### Option 1: Consistent method declaration (recommended)\n\nDefine `foo` formally in both classes:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      # No dynamic method creation\n    },\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Option 2: Consistent dynamic creation\n\nIf you need to create methods dynamically in both classes:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      super$initialize()\n      # Override the dynamically created method\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print(\"Child's foo\")\n        # Call parent's foo - more complex because super won't work here\n        environment(self$parent_env$foo)$self <- self$parent_env\n        self$parent_env$foo()\n      }\n    },\n    parent_env = NULL\n  )\n)\n\n# Special initialize to store parent reference\nc <- Child$new()\nc$parent_env <- Parent$new()\nc$foo()\n```\n\nFor clarity and maintainability, I strongly recommend Option 1 - defining methods in the formal class definition rather than creating them dynamically, unless you have a specific reason for needing dynamic method creation.\n***\n[Criterion]: To change a locked binding, use `unlockBinding()`, as in:\n\n```\n    initialize = function() {\n      unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

In your current implementation, you've defined the `output$plot` outside of the server function, but you're only referencing it inside the server function without actually executing the rendering code.\n\n## Here's how to fix it:\n\n1. Move the `output$plot` rendering code inside the server function\n2. Make sure the reactive expressions are also defined inside the server function\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\n# Define UI\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define server logic\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive expressions inside the server function\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Define the output$plot rendering inside the server function\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n    # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n## What was fixed:\n\n1. Moved all reactive expressions inside the server function\n2. Removed the standalone reactive expressions for `ckd_condition` and `visit_threshold` since you can directly use `input$condition` and `input$visit_threshold`\n3. Properly defined the server function and included the `output$plot` rendering code inside it\n4. Fixed the app structure to correctly follow the Shiny application pattern\n\nThis should resolve your error and get your app working correctly."

This is what's causing the \"Can't read output 'plot'\" error.\n\nThe submission proposes a proper solution by:\n1. Moving the `output$plot` rendering code inside the server function\n2. Properly structuring the server function definition\n3. Moving all reactive expressions inside the server function\n4. Removing the unnecessary standalone reactive expressions for `ckd_condition` and `visit_threshold`\n\nThe proposed solution matches the required fix outlined in the criterion. The submission demonstrates understanding that:\n- The server function needs to be properly defined\n- The `output$plot` rendering code needs to be inside this function\n- Reactive expressions need to be properly placed\n\nThe submission goes beyond the minimum requirement by also cleaning up other aspects of the code, making it more concise and organized.\n\nGRADE: C",

It appears to be an internal function used within dplyr but not meant for direct use by other packages.\n\n## Options to Resolve This Issue\n\n1. **Import the function properly**:\n   If you need to use this internal function, you should import it correctly in your NAMESPACE file using `importFrom(dplyr, closest)`. However, this might not work if the function is truly internal.\n\n2. **Use the `:::`-operator for non-exported functions**:\n   You can access non-exported functions using the triple colon operator:\n   ```r\n   dplyr:::closest()\n   ```\n   However, this is generally discouraged for package development as it creates a dependency on internal functions that might change without notice.\n\n3. **Find an alternative function**:\n   The most reliable solution is to find a proper exported function or implement the functionality yourself.\n\n4. **Check if you're using the function name correctly**:\n   Verify you're not mixing up function names or packages.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIf you need this functionality in your package:\n\n1. **Copy the function implementation** into your own package and properly credit dplyr\n2. **Reach out to the dplyr maintainers** to see if there's an exported alternative\n3. **Consider if a different approach** is possible without using this internal function\n\nBe aware that relying on non-exported functions creates a fragile dependency that could break with dplyr updates.",
