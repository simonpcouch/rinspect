\title{Convert a chat to a solver function}
\usage{
generate(solver_chat = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{solver_chat}{An ellmer chat object, such as from \code{\link[ellmer:chat_anthropic]{ellmer::chat_anthropic()}}.}
}
\value{
The output of \code{generate()} is another function. That function takes in
a vector of \code{input}s, as well as a solver chat by the
name of \code{solver_chat} with the default supplied to \code{generate()} itself.

See the documentation for the \code{solver} argument in \link{Task} for more
information on the return type.
}
\description{
\code{generate()} is the simplest possible solver one might use with
vitals; it just passes its inputs to the supplied model and returns
its raw responses. The inputs are evaluated in parallel,
not in the sense of multiple R sessions, but in the sense of multiple,
asynchronous HTTP requests using \code{\link[ellmer:parallel_chat]{ellmer::parallel_chat()}}. \code{generate()}'s output
can be passed directory to the \code{solver} argument of \link{Task}'s \verb{$new()}
method.

  # evaluate the task (runs solver and scorer) and opens
  # the results in the Inspect log viewer (if interactive)
  tsk$eval()

  # $eval() is shorthand for:
  tsk$solve()
  tsk$score()
  tsk$measure()
  tsk$log()
  tsk$view()

  # get the evaluation results as a data frame
  tsk$get_samples()

  # view the task directory with $view() or vitals_view()
