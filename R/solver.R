#' Convert a chat to a solver function
#'
#' @description
#' `generate()` is the simplest possible solver one might use with 
#' rinspect; it just passes its inputs to the supplied model and returns
#' its raw responses. The inputs are evaluated in parallel, 
#' not in the sense of multiple R sessions, but in the sense of multiple, 
#' asynchronous HTTP requests using `$chat_parallel()`. `generate()`'s output 
#' can be passed directory to the `solver` argument of [Task]'s `$new()`
#' method.
#' 
#' @param solver_chat An ellmer chat object, such as from [ellmer::chat_anthropic()].
#'
#' @returns 
#' The output of `generate()` is another function. That function takes in
#' a vector of `input`s, as well as a solver chat by the 
#' name of `solver_chat` with the default supplied to `generate()` itself.
#' 
#' See the documentation for the `solver` argument in [Task] for more 
#' information on the return type.
