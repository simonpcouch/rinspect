#' An R Eval
#'
#' @description
#' An R Eval is a dataset of challenging R coding problems. Each `input` is a 
#' question about R code which could be solved on first-read only by experts 
#' and, with a chance to read documentation and run some code, by 
#' fluent data scientists. Solutions are in `target()` and enable a fluent 
#' data scientist to evaluate whether the solution deserves full, partial, or
#' no credit.
#' 
#' Pass this dataset to `Task$new()` to situate it inside of an evaluation
#' task.
#' 
#' @format A tibble with `r nrow(are)` rows and `r ncol(are)` columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{title}{Character. Unique identifier/title for the code problem.}
#'   \item{input}{Character. The question to be answered.}
#'   \item{target}{Character. The solution, often with a description of notable
#'   features of a correct solution.}
#'   \item{domain}{Character. The technical domain 
#'   (e.g., Data Analysis, Programming, or Authoring).}
#'   \item{task}{Character. Type of task 
#'   (e.g., Debugging, New feature, or Translation.)}
#'   \item{source}{Character. URL or source of the problem. `NA`s indicate that
#'   the problem was written originally for this eval.}
#'   \item{knowledge}{List. Required knowledge/concepts for solving the problem.}
#' }

#' @source Posit Community, GitHub issues, R4DS solutions, etc. For row-level
#' references, see `source`.
